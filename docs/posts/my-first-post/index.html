I am writing this in obsidian before I attempt to push it over to hugo and then to github sites, we shall see how it goes.\nhere is my favourite meme:\nAlso here is some text that should be like kinda big lol hope this works.\nwould also like to see if formatting for bullet points works so that would be cool if it works lets give it a go! What I wrote after I got it working: OH MY! okay so it is currently about a day and a half since I wrote the first half of this, and I am extremely happy to say that while it was super difficult to get some bits and bobs working, I was able to get there!\nI rebuilt the website from scratch several times while trying to get it working, in the end I was plagued with an issue with getting images to display on github pages, thankfully after MANY HOURS of troubleshooting I was able to find the solution.\nmy current system is finally in a good place, in it’s current state I follow these steps:\nwrite a post in a posts folder in my obsidian vault (like I am doing right now) run my custom powershell script push my changes to github with github desktop one could have the powershell script handle the pushing to github as well, however I like the added “safety” of being able to manually review what will be pushed before sending it, especially as this posts folder exists in my larger obsidian vault.\nthere are still more features I hope to get working, such as embedding videos and excalidraw documents, but for now things are in a useful enough state for me to actually start writing some silly blog posts.\nbig thankyou to Rhys for helping me with some html trouble shooting, aswell as some of the following links (a later blog post on exactly how to setup a github pages
