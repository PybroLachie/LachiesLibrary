    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am still having a few issues, however major headway has been made, I have managed to get the Hugo site readable on GitHub pages with the correct theme formatting, it would appear that images are still struggling though, I will add an image below this to use in my further testing:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my second attempt at following the network chuck video on creating a blog using obsidian, I will this time be doing more of a hybrid between what he has created, and what I want, using bits and bobs I fill out along the way. I am writing this in obsidian before I attempt to push it over to hugo and then to github sites, we shall see how it goes.</p>]]></description>
