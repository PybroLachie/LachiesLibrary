    <description><![CDATA[<p>this note is not a real post, rather it is a test for some of the different formatting options I have here inside of obsidian, so that I can see what makes it over to html.</p>

<h2 id="back-story">Back Story</h2>
<p>I’ve been playing TTRPGs (specifically D&amp;D 5e) for quite a while now, both as a player and as a DM, and combat naturally is a large part of those games, up until recently all combat I have ever played has been “theatre of the mind” and while there is nothing wrong with that (in fact in certain cases it is likely superior) I had always wanted to do tactical combat on a battle map, however as I spent many of my early D&amp;D playing years as a teenager with no disposable income – the cost for minis and maps was just too much to justify when I would often only play a few sessions a year. What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-i-wrote-before-i-got-it-working">What I wrote before I got it working:</h1>
<p>This is my second attempt at following the network chuck video on creating a blog using obsidian, I will this time be doing more of a hybrid between what he has created, and what I want, using bits and bobs I fill out along the way. I am writing this in obsidian before I attempt to push it over to hugo and then to github sites, we shall see how it goes.</p>]]></description>
