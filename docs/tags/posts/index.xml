    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-i-wrote-before-i-got-it-working">What I wrote before I got it working:</h1>
<p>This is my second attempt at following the network chuck video on creating a blog using obsidian, I will this time be doing more of a hybrid between what he has created, and what I want, using bits and bobs I fill out along the way. I am writing this in obsidian before I attempt to push it over to hugo and then to github sites, we shall see how it goes.</p>]]></description>
