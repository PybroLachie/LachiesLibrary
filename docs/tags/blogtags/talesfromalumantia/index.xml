      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;eyes-on-some-new-transport&#34;&gt;Eyes on some new transport&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my goal finding a village complete, it was time to re-focus my attention of transport, often my transportation of these villagers would involve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nether portals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buckets of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of patience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I mentioned in my last post I had recently updated to minecraft version 1.21.6, which among other things contained the happy ghast, and one awesome feature of these friendly flying creatures is the ability to attach a boat to them using leads, this feels like the perfect early game method for transporting villagers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tales from Alumantia Pt.2 - Laying the foundation</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;picking-up-where-i-left-off&#34;&gt;Picking up where I left off&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my next session with exactly what I had planned when I left off last time, I ventured my way down the mountain side, and made my way towards the clearing that I showed in my last post. when I arrived I checked out the directly surrounding forest entrance, when I did I was greeted by this absolutely delightful bit of world gen!

I know I know, mods have been doing this for years (trust me I&amp;rsquo;ve installed them many times), but there was something about seeing this little diorama in my vanilla playthrough that just made me happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tales from Alumantia Pt.0 - Starting a forever world</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a silly thing to blog, but that has never stopped me before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My early days of playing minecraft were spent playing a free light weight creative only version of the game through a web browser, a version that is today known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Classic&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;minecraft classic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, some time later (bare in mind I was around the age of 8 or 9 years old at this time and my memory of the passing of time from then is not fantastic) a newer version of minecraft of the game was announced, one that would require a paid account (This version of the game is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Indev&#34;&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;). Some classic childhood parental begging occurred - a joint effort between me and my older brother, and some time later they agreed to buy an account for the 2 of us to share (best day ever, thanks mum and dad).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tales from Alumantia Pt.1 - A fresh start</title>
      <link>https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/tales-from-alumantia-pt.1---a-fresh-start/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;World seed for those interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Seed: -1412583731547517931
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world-begins&#34;&gt;The world begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spawning in and taking a look around, I am immediately greeted by some absolutely stunning visuals, giving me an even deeper appreciation for the work that has been done by Mojang on the world generation system, I may be very nostalgic for the old beta style terrain, but this new system is beautiful.
&lt;img alt=&#34;Image Description&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.1%20-%20A%20fresh%20start.png&#34;&gt;The visuals of sprawling lush landscape and intensified by the shader pack I am using, The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/complementary-unbound&#34;&gt;Complementary shaders - unbound&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I am a huge fan of this shader pack as I find it delivers not only stellar performance (I see my framerate hovering between 150-160fps) but I also find that it delivers moody but &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; visuals at night time and inside dark caves, where as some other shader packs I have used look great with lots of light, but strain my eyes by making things too dark.
&lt;img alt=&#34;Image Description&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.1%20-%20A%20fresh%20start-20250618162840196.png&#34;&gt;
Admittedly the high performance I experience with these shaders is partially accredited to the specs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-home-pc-setup/&#34;&gt;my PC&lt;/a&gt;, but I have found that these shaders set to lower settings can still produce very playable framerates on my laptop, which is of lower specs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
