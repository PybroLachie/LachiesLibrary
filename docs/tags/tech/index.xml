    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro-and-disclaimer">Intro and disclaimer</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: This is my personal setup for game development and 3D art, I obtained parts of it over a long period of time including before attending college, during my studies, and after I started working professionally. I point this out as it is important to me that anyone reading this who is interested in getting into game dev understands that they <strong>Do not</strong> need to obtain this kind of equipment to get started, I started 3D modelling on an <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/179172?baseline=179172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">old Toshiba laptop</a> with no graphics card and 4gb of DDR3 RAM, and later built a simple PC with an <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QbGj4D/intel-core-i5-7500-34ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i57500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">i5-7500</a> processor and a <a href="https://www.mwave.com.au/archive/asus-geforce-gtx-1050-phoenix-2gb-video-card-ac08304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">GTX 1050</a> graphics card which actually did quite well for a long time, so please do not let a lack of equipment prevent you from getting started.</p>]]></description>
