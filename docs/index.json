Just remember, the best way to learn D\u0026amp;D is by playing it! So make a character, learn what you can about gameplay, and any gaps in your knowledge will be filled as you play!\nIf you wish to gain a high level overview of the game before any further reading, I recommend you watch this video by Ginny Di on YouTube, it is intended for people using the 2024 rules so a few words are slightly different however pretty much all of the explanation of how the game is played is the same.\nTechnical Info My D\u0026amp;D games use the D\u0026amp;D 5e (2014) ruleset, This is not to be confused with the D\u0026amp;D 5.5e (2024) ruleset, It is easy to set D\u0026amp;D beyond to use the 2014 rules only so that you do not need to worry about it, I will go over this when I talk about D\u0026amp;D beyond later. What is D\u0026amp;D / How do I play? High level D\u0026amp;D Description D\u0026amp;D Is a TTRPG (Table top roleplaying game), Which is to say that you play the game by sitting around a table narrating your actions. In the case of D\u0026amp;D there are 2 types of players;\nPlayer characters Dungeon master A dungeon master is responsible for narrating the overall story, controlling NPCs (non-player characters), and overall running the game. A Player character (That\u0026rsquo;s you!) is responsible for controlling and narrating the actions of their individual character. Actions as a player character As a player you can essentially break down everything you do into 2 categories:\nOut of combat When out of combat, players are free to perform various actions at will, these actions include but are not limited to:\ntraveling from location to location (often within a town or settlement) speaking with NPCs (the player speaks as themselves and the DM speaks as the NPC the player is talking to) Bartering (functions the same as speaking with NPCs) exploring locations (either publicly or by sneaking around, this often includes skill checks which we will talk about later) Performing other miscellaneous actions. Some of these actions will require skill checks to perform, while others are just assumed possible, we will talk about skill checks later. In combat During combat the game becomes turn based, The order of turns is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll of a D20 + plus your initiative modifier (we will speak about modifiers later when we speak about skill checks). I will explain combat further in one of the next sections.\nThe Dice! If you know nothing else about D\u0026amp;D you will likely at least know 1 thing - there are lots of dice! these dice like in any game are used for generating random numbers, these numbers include the damage of weapons, the amount of heath regained by drinking a potion, etc. every item, spell, and weapon that involves a dice roll specifies which one it needs by identifying the die as a \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; followed by the number of sides, for example a 6 sided die is referred to as a \u0026ldquo;D6\u0026rdquo;, a 12 sided die is referred to as a \u0026ldquo;D12\u0026rdquo; etc. Notes:\n0 = maximum value: You will notice that the D10 has a 0 on it, it is important to note that this 0 actually represents 10. The D100: there will be times where you DM, or a class feature ask you to roll a \u0026ldquo;D100\u0026rdquo; you will notice that there is no 100 sided die in a standard set of dice. this roll is actually done by rolling the D10 along with the percentile die, adding the resulting numbers together. It is important to note that when rolling a D100 the 0 actually represents 0 instead of maximum value, unless you roll entirely 0s, in which case you have rolled a perfect 100 Multiple Dice: sometimes a weapon, spell, etc. Will call for rolling multiple dice, they will list this by writing the Number followed by the type, for example: 3D6 means roll 3 six sided dice. You do not need to buy any! if you have your own that you want to bring then that is totally encouraged! however I have plenty of spare dice for you to borrow if you like :)\nSkill checks / Saving throws At this stage I have mentioned skill checks a couple times, D\u0026amp;D contains a series of skills used to attempt various tasks (Acrobatics, Deception, Stealth, etc.) every character has a modifier (sometimes positive, sometimes neutral, sometimes negative) for each of these skills listed on their character sheet, these are determined during the character creation process (more on that later).\nTo perform a skill check, roll a D20, and add your modifier for the relevant skill, for example if your DM asks you to make a stealth check, then you roll a D20, and apply your stealth modifier to the result of the roll; After you roll your skill check and add the modifier you tell your DM the final number, they will then tell you if you failed or succeeded in what you were trying to do. It is important to note that ==in order to make a skill check to attempt something you must first be asked / approved to do so.== for example you may say that you want to try and break down a door, your DM will ask you to make a strength check (for example), then you will do it and say the result. You can not however simply roll a strength check without asking and then say \u0026ldquo;hey I wanna knock down the door also I rolled a 16\u0026rdquo;, the reasoning for this will become clear as you play the game, but it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about keeping discussions / options clear as well as giving your DM the opportunity to tell you that you can not do something / give your fellow players the chance you talk you out of it.\nIf you wish to accomplish a task in a certain way then you can request the specific skill check, for example if you want to get through a door by picking the lock, you can specifically ask your DM \u0026ldquo;Hey I want to try and get through this door, can I make a slight of hand check to try picking the lock on the door\u0026rdquo;. Requests like this will feel more natural to you as you keep playing the game, but at the start it is totally fine to just say \u0026ldquo;hey I want to try and get through this door\u0026rdquo; and let your DM tell you what check to make.\nYou should also note that not every action in the game requires a skill check, for example if you want to just pick up a simple object or walk across a room for example, you just say that you do it, no check required. If you feel unsure as to if you can perform an action, just say that you try to do it and the DM will tell you if a check is required, you will get a feel for it as you play.\nSaving throws function the exact same way to skill checks, the only difference is that it is typically called a skill check when proactively trying to do something, while it is typically called a saving throw when reacting to something. For example you may make a dexterity skill check to try and throw something at someone, while that someone may make a dexterity saving throw to try and dodge it. ==The mechanics are exactly the same, just different words and they often get interchanged.==\nCombat!

The cloud sync hard drive: I use drop box for cloud storage for all my work, I enjoy the comfort of having a cloud backup and access to my files without remembering to bring a hard drive with me, however the one downside of using cloud storage can be waiting for files to sync, to remove this down side I have a 2TB m.2 (for high speed) SSD which I have my ENTIRE drop box account constantly syncing to, it may be seen as a little overkill, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s perfect, and offers the best of both worlds regarding cloud storage / working locally.

Wacom intous pro medium: this is the tablet to get! that said many alternatives from huion or others can also work great and be at least 80% as good. what is more important on a tablet hunt is to get one without a screen, I used to use a very large screen tablet, it was a good tablet and for someone doing a lot more 2D art it may be the better device, however for 3D art where tasks are often changing as you work through the pipeline, I found that the larger device took too long to get setup (even when being used as a monitor in it\u0026rsquo;s down time) and also provided worse ergonomics due to the neck needing to be craned down even a little bit when using it.

Google home: This lives on the desk so it is included on the list, it is good for some music and hands free controlling some home systems, it was also a birthday gift, I love it but would not recommend buying it for the purposes of making art. Network switch: good if you have a single cord running to your office / room and want a wired connection to few devices (in my case my main PC, my media PC, and a WIFI booster ) Placement fixings: I use these to secure items like the wireless charger and speaker stands to my desk, this comes in handy if you are a bit particular like me and want to make sure things will stay the safe after giving your setup a good clean. Knick-knack box: it\u0026rsquo;s a silly thing to recommend, but having a small box handy for USBs, trinkets, adapters, etc. can really help keep your space clear, for the couple dollars they go for its a huge recommend!

During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything). take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine). the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife. it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises. place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap. leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours. if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount. Method - working with the dough preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius. line a pizza tray with baking paper. take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour. take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour. if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle. press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed. transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this). add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese. repeat for remaining dough balls. cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base. Notes: for an extra crunchy crust, you can add a light brushing of olive oil to the outer rim of your pizza ","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/pizza-dough-recipie/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"info\"\u003eInfo:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003cth style=\"text-align: right\"\u003eYield:\u003c/th\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003e3 pizza bases\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd style=\"text-align: right\"\u003eCook time (dough making and rising)\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e90 minutes\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd style=\"text-align: right\"\u003eCook time (pressing dough and cooking)\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e30 minutes\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"equipment-required\"\u003eEquipment Required:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMixer with dough hooks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 stainless steel or ceramic bowls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eplastic wrap\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ingredients\"\u003eIngredients:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 cup of warm water (about 40 degrees Celsius)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e8 grams of dry yeast\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 teaspoons of sugar\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1/2 teaspoon of salt\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 1/2 cups of plain flour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e5 tablespoons of olive oil for cooking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"method---creating-the-dough\"\u003eMethod - creating the dough\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlace water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour in mixing bowl, mix on lowest setting until just combined.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadd 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 30 seconds\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadd 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 8 minutes (giving your mixer breaks based on your instruction manual).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDuring or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact!

What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.\nHow it started The idea to print out my own minis first came from seeing it on a YouTube video by “power word spill” on YouTube and I started out creating minis exactly as he recommended, sourcing art from the website printable heroes, printing and cutting, and using binder clips as a cheap and effective base. I found a bulk packet of binder clips on amazon and also found some relatively cheap card stock as I wanted to make sure the minis did not feel flimsy – regular printer paper was not quite going to cut it.\nMy first test As you can see the results were decent, however the print quality (which I later found out was my printer running low on ink) left something to be desired, but the concept was there.\nAt this stage I want to point out that I did do one thing differently to the defined method for making these minis, I used my die cutting machine to cut the mini rather than a craft knife, I left this out earlier as I do not want anyone reading to think they need a die cutting machine to create these minis – a craft knife and a little patience will absolutely do it! I just already had a machine for other craft projects and wanted to get some extra use out of it. The process of making these on the machine was easy, I just opened the PDF from printable heroes in photoshop (you could do this for free in a program like krita), and isolated the image I wanted to print and cut.\nBut what about custom minis? this was all a great start, but what about minis we wanted to play with that did not have preexisting printable mini sheets just laying around on the internet, such as our own player characters or custom NPCs, or the DMs custom creatures? Well this is where a little more photoshop (or in this case affinity designer) came into play.\nBe it hand drawn, rendered, or something found on the internet, I needed to find a way to get any image ready to be printed and cut using the same method we had established for the art from printable heroes, to do this I started by isolating the art from the background in photoshop (ideally you start with some art without a background, but that is not always the case)\nWith the background isolated, it became a simple matter of using photoshop to generate an outline, adding a black semicircle as a guide for the base, then duplicating and flipping everything. I now had a printable mini.\n^ My character “Jacklyn” created in hero forge, screenshotted, background isolated in photoshop, and the final ready for print and cut version.\nThe Dry Erase Minis This is an idea I was very proud of, I took some generic character art and isolated it\u0026rsquo;s silhouette making it white, I then gave it the same ready to print treatment that I gave all the minis before this, however before folding them I covered them in some clear adhesive laminate, this left me with a handful of minis that the DM can use dry erase markers to quickly label on the fly for unexpected encounters.\nNotes \u0026amp; Final Results An important bit of wisdom shared by power word spill in his YouTube video is that you are better of making minis as you need them, rather than creating a bunch of minis that you may or may not end up needing in the future.\nmy personal advice to anyone wanting to try these out would be to create the following before your first session playing with minis:\nA copy of each NPC that could end up in combat THIS SESSION (no need to create NPCs your players will not meet, or ones that will never be in a fight). a handful of generic \u0026ldquo;bad guys\u0026rdquo; from your campaign setting, when in doubt, a few goblins and a few kobolds are a good place to start. a mini for each player character (if you can get some assorted ones, I recommend using binder clips of a different colour for player characters, it can really help speed up combat). a handful of blank minis for improvised encounters.

Resource tracking Ammo non magical or otherwise non-modified ammo is not tracked, if you have a bow and quiver with 20 arrows, it is assumed that you manage to retrieve them from the battlefield during / after combat. If combat reaches a point where you may have actually used all 20 arrows (rare) then I may tell you that your quiver has run dry - however you do not need to track this, I will. the same goes for crossbow bolts, slingshot ammo, etc.\nmagical or otherwise modified ammo is tracked, and is often consumed on use, for example a magical arrow that does an additional 1d6 frost damage, would either be destroyed, or converted back into a regular arrow after firing it. modified items such as poisoned darts can be collected but in their regular state, for example if you fired a poisoned dart at a creature, you could reclaim it after combat, but it would now be a regular dart.\nMisc Drinking a potion is a bonus action You may use your bonus action to consume a potion.
