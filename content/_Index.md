# Welcome to Lachie's Library!

### About me

My name is Lachie, I am a professional 3D artist and game developer, with a bunch of other hobbies, including gaming, playing and running D&D, world building, building computers, camping, cooking, and more. I created this website as a place to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects- The silly ones and the cool ones alike! along with some custom resources for various hobbies I have created and would like to share.

### Why make a website?

I have always had a habit of developing random interests and hobbies that I tend to get very deep into rather quickly, some of these last for a few weeks, others a few months, and some I have been interested in and working on for over a decade now. throughout all these hobbies and interests I would often attempt to take notes and document my workflows, however for a long time I got stuck on trying to organise my thoughts, and the organisation and documentation became it's own fixation, one I found overwhelming, and often ended up doing poorly or not at all due to a lack of a proper system.

This all changed for me when I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), A free markdown based note taking program that allowed me to shape my note taking system to be whatever I needed it to be, as well as learning about some popular "[second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)" methods including [PARA](https://workflowy.com/systems/para-method/#:~:text=The%20system%20was%20developed%20by,work%20at%20his%20consulting%20job.) by Tiago Forte, and [zettelkasten](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=The%20Zettelkasten%20method%20was%20invented,system%2C%20dubbed%20the%20Zettelkasten%20method.) by Niklas Luhmann, both of which I use elements of in my own hybrid note taking system today.

The tools and systems I learnt changed everything for me, making me feel free to dump hoards of random information that I have been carrying around in my brain, as well as giving some much needed organisation to the jumble of world documents, phone notes, notebooks, and other scribbles I have had all over the place to keep track of things I was learning, all of which now live as digitized markdown files in my obsidian vault. now when I start a new project, be that something creative, or just simply doing some research on finding a nice pair of shoes, I start an obsidian note (or sometimes a folder) under the appropriate category in my vault to help me keep track of my thoughts and progress.

Today I have a decently sized (and growing) collection of notes on all sorts of topics that I have developed interests in over time, and on occasion I find myself with some notes I would like to put out into the world, either because I have been specifically asked to like in the case of some recipes, or because I have spent some time creating some resources and documenting some workflows for hobbies that I know will likely benefit someone looking for them, such as my post on [creating cheap miniatures for D&D](https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/making-paper-minis/). and that is why in the year 2025, I created my own website.
