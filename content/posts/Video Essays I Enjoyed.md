As the title says, I wanted to share a few of my favourite video essays, I will attempt to loosely sort them into vague categories (gaming, mystery, movies, etc.) I will also *try* to give a content warning for any that are a bit dark, but no promises as some of these ones I will list at first are ones I watched a while ago. I will update this list as I consume more content. 

Note: This list is not exhaustive and will not contain **every** video essay I have seen, rather it will contain the ones I enjoyed the most and would recommend most people see (provided they have an interest in the subject).
