# Intro and disclaimer

Disclaimer: This is my personal setup for game development and 3D art, I obtained parts of it over a long period of time including before attending college, during my studies, and after I started working professionally, I point this out as it is important to me that anyone reading this who is interested in getting into game dev understands that they **Do not need** to obtain this kind of equipment to get started, I started 3D modelling on an old Toshiba laptop with no graphics card and 4gb of DDR3 RAM,  so please do not let a lack of equipment prevent you from getting started.

With that out of the way, I am excited to share with you my personal setup for creating art, making games, and of course- a little bit of gaming.

I am going to take this moment to re assert that this setup is not only my work station but also one I use for gaming and other hobbies, that is to say - you absolutely do not need a stream deck for creating 3D art!! I do however find it very helpful for controlling my virtual webcam during meetings and while running online classes.
