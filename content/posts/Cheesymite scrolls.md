	1. if the sheets are still frozen together, use the edge of a sharp knife to leverage them apart.
4. coat each sheet in a thin layer of vegemite, remember that each scroll will end up with several layers of this coating, so don't put it on too strong.
5. sprinkle cheese over each covered sheet of pastry.
6. roll into logs, using the egg yolk to seal them together.
7. cover each log in the remaining egg yolk
8. cut each log into 8 slices.
9. place slices on their side on a baking tray/s
10. bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown
