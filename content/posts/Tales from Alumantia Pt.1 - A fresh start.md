### The world begins
Spawning in and taking a look around, I am immediately greeted by some absolutely stunning visuals, giving me an even deeper appreciation for the work that has been done by Mojang on the world generation system, I may be very nostalgic for the old beta style terrain, but this new system is beautiful. 
![Image Description](/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.1%20-%20A%20fresh%20start.png)The visuals of sprawling lush landscape and intensified by the shader pack I am using, The "[Complementary shaders - unbound](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/complementary-unbound)", I am a huge fan of this shader pack as I find it delivers not only stellar performance (I see my framerate hovering between 150-160fps) but I also find that it delivers moody but **clear** visuals at night time and inside dark caves, where as some other shader packs I have used look great with lots of light, but strain my eyes by making things too dark.

Admittedly the high performance I experience with these shaders is partially accredited to the specs of [my PC](https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-home-pc-setup/), but I have found that these shaders set to lower settings can still produce very playable framerates on my laptop, which is of lower specs.

After I was done admiring my surroundings I went straight to the nearby patch of cherry blossom trees to acquire some wood and saplings, this is my favourite tree that has been added to the game thus far. I explored for a small time before finding that one of the nearby mountains had a giant flat surface at the top, with an absolutely breathtaking view of the surrounding area. This would be where I setup for my first few nights in the game, with a fantastic view to plan development in the surrounding areas.

I mined some of the hill sides for resources and politely asked a few sheep and cows for their meat, before throwing together a quick starter house as it quickly darkened. Here was my house for night 1, it's not beautiful, but it beats a dirt shack (just about).

On my second day I got to work chopping trees, I started building what I had planned to be the bedroom for my new starter base, with a great lookout over the surrounding biomes, however my few trips up and down the mountain during this process led me to decide that any frequent access location built up here should be made for later in the playthrough when I have access to an elytra, so I continued to build the room, but more as a lookout rather than a house.

I did temporarily move my bed and some other things into this lookout (beats the night 1 house), however this is short term until I make a new place. The view from the lookout is perfect, and I captured a rather pleasing view of the virtual sunset.

One thing I did discover while exploring my mountain top was a wonderful clearing with a picturesque lake down the opisite side of the mountain to spawn, I feel confident that this is where I will set up my new starter base when I next play.

This is about the end of my first session in this world, spare for a little more mining and building a modest farm and setting up a few chests.

And that's it! definitely a smaller session (I was tired) but a nice start for sure, next time I play I will be exploring the clearing I showed above and setting up a proper starter base to with some storage.
