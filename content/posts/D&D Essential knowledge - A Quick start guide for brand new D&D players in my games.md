## Intro
If you are reading this then chances are you are a brand new (or returning) D&D player, welcome to the table! What is to follow is my attempt to condense down all essential first time D&D knowledge into a simple and easy to follow guide. Just remember, the best way to learn D&D is by playing it! So make a character, learn what you can about gameplay, and any gaps in your knowledge will be filled as you play! 

If you wish to gain a high level overview of the game before any further reading, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNNBjVmNbQI&t=304s) by Ginny Di on YouTube, it is intended for people using the 2024 rules so a few words are slightly different however pretty much all of the explanation of how the game is played is the same.
### Technical Info
- My D&D games use the D&D 5e (2014) ruleset, This is not to be confused with the D&D 5.5e (2024) ruleset, It is easy to set D&D beyond to use the 2014 rules only so that you do not need to worry about it, I will go over this when I talk about D&D beyond later.
### What is D&D / How do I play?
D&D Is a TTRPG (Table top roleplaying game), Which is to say that you play the game by sitting around a table narrating your actions. In the case of D&D there are 2 types of players;
1. Player characters 
2. Dungeon master
A dungeon master is responsible for narrating the overall story, controlling NPCs (non-player characters), and overall running the game. A Player character (That's you!) is responsible for controlling and narrating the actions of their individual character.

As a player you can *essentially* break down everything you do into 2 categories:
#### Out of combat
When out of combat, players are free to perform various actions at will, these actions include but are not limited to: 
- traveling from location to location (often within a town or settlement)
- speaking with NPCs (the player speaks as themselves and the DM speaks as the NPC the player is talking to)
- Bartering (functions the same as speaking with NPCs)
- exploring locations (either publicly or by sneaking around, this often includes skill checks which we will talk about later)
- Performing other miscellaneous actions. 
Some of these actions will require skill checks to perform, while others are just assumed possible, we will talk about skill checks later.
#### In combat
During combat the game becomes turn based, The order of turns is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll of a D20 + plus your initiative modifier (we will speak about modifiers later when we speak about skill checks)
