### Info:

|                                 Yield: | 3 pizza bases |
| -------------------------------------: | ------------- |
|    Cook time (dough making and rising) | 90 minutes    |
| Cook time (pressing dough and cooking) | 30 minutes    |

### Equipment Required:
- Mixer with dough hooks
- 3 stainless steel or ceramic bowls
- plastic wrap

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup of warm water (about 40 degrees Celsius)
- 8 grams of dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 3 1/2 cups of plain flour
- 5 tablespoons of olive oil for cooking

### Method - creating the dough
1. Place water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour in mixing bowl, mix on lowest setting until just combined.
2. add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 30 seconds
3. add 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 8 minutes (giving your mixer breaks based on your instruction manual).
4. During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything).
5. take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine).
	1. the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife.
	2. it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises.
6. place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap.
7. leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours.
	1. if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount.

### Method - working with the dough
1. preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius.
2. line a pizza tray with baking paper.
3. take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour.
4. take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour.
	1. if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle.
5. press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed.
6. transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this).
7. add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese.
8. repeat for remaining dough balls.
9. cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base.

### Notes:
- for an extra crunchy crust, you can add a light brushing of olive oil to the outer rim of your pizza
