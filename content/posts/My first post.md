# What I wrote before I got it working:

This is my second attempt at following the network chuck video on creating a blog using obsidian, I will this time be doing more of a hybrid between what he has created, and what I want, using bits and bobs I fill out along the way. I am writing this in obsidian before I attempt to push it over to hugo and then to github sites, we shall see how it goes.

here is my favourite meme:

## Also here is some text that should be like kinda big lol
hope this works.
- would also like to see if formatting for bullet points works
- so that would be cool
- if it works
- lets give it a go!

# What I wrote after I got it working:

OH MY! okay so it is currently about a day and a half since I wrote the first half of this, and I am extremely happy to say that while it was super difficult to get some bits and bobs working, I was able to get there! 

I rebuilt the website from scratch several times while trying to get it working, in the end I was plagued with an issue with getting images to display on github pages, thankfully after MANY HOURS of troubleshooting I was able to find the solution.

my current system is finally in a good place, in it's current state I follow these steps:

- write a post in a posts folder in my obsidian vault (like I am doing right now)
- run my custom powershell script
- push my changes to github with github desktop

one could have the powershell script handle the pushing to github as well, however I like the added "safety" of being able to manually review what will be pushed before sending it, especially as this posts folder exists in my larger obsidian vault.

there are still more features I hope to get working, such as embedding videos and excalidraw documents, but for now things are in a useful enough state for me to actually start writing some silly blog posts.

big thankyou to Rhys for helping me with some html trouble shooting, aswell as some of the following links (a later blog post on exactly how to setup a github pages obsidian repo the way I have done it is to come at a later date):
