At the start of my next session I had spotted some sheep, and decided I had better section a few off to start a farm to save myself from searching for them later, I tied them up next to my cows while I built a little sheep pen, I had no reference for this and may refine the design in future, but for now I was happy with this! Rock and stone! I had continued to trade with villagers and had acquired what I needed to set up a basic silk touch pickaxe, combining this with stone masons I could now essentially print money just by mining plain old stone! problem was I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have anything that needed digging at the time, so I carved out a room in the side of a small hill, not really sure what I will use it for, but hey it\u0026rsquo;s there now. I also went spelunking for a bit, explored a mineshaft, and found some pumpkin seeds and glow berries! then I went home and got some stone masons set up to make use of the stone I had gathered. The Garden of greatness! At this stage I was honestly starting to feel a little aimless, I had made quite a few of the practical builds that I wanted, and was not sure what I wanted to make next, I loaded up an old server I used to play for for inspiration, and inspiration I found! I was going to make a garden! it would mostly serve as eye candy, but would also be a place I could go to bone meal copies of plants for dye and decoration.\nThe first step was to start clearing land! I may have gone a little overboard, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s the danger of having a good podcast going while you play minecraft, and I will use all this space for something!\nYou may have also noticed that I am building this farm elevated from the rest of my base, my friends are always bullying me for building everything on the same level encouraging me to built with verticality! and honestly I did not want to dig out this hill so it was a perfect opportunity to try it! the hill was a bit steep to naturally blend into my main base level though so instead of making a weird looking mound I decided to build a retaining wall! It adds a nice little border to the garden and I think it works rather well! when I was done with this I moved on to starting to mark out the border of the garden, again I am going into this with more of a blank canvas approach rather than a specific build in mind, so I just kind of winged it, after I marked my borders I added some flower beds! I was quite pleased with how these flower beds were looking, but you may have noticed from the fence post in the last image that I was intending to put a cover over the plants, gotta keep em safe! I messed around with a couple designs before ending on a simple leaf and slab checker pattern, I then got my Gregory (my happy ghast) for a view birds eye view (more for fun than anything really) the garden had increased the footprint of my base by quite a lot and I was feeling very pleased with how the overall area was looking! Mooshrooms! There was more work done on the garden which you will see before this post is over, however before then I took a side quest for a flight around, I was already on my ghast so I may aswell, on my travels I found some ice spike biomes, and going a little further I saw a mooshroom island!, I normally use a seed inspector to find these but on this world I decided not to use anything like that so discovering it naturally felt really good! a few trips back and forward from my base were required, but I eventually managed to safely transport a couple mooshrooms home! they will live with the sheep for now, but plans for a soup kitchen are brewing in my head. To the nether! (again) I really wanted to start brewing some potions in my world, mostly speed potions, but also I wanted some for zombifying and curing villagers to get better trades, this meant traveling the nether for a LONG time (hours of my life), I found a lot of structures including bastions, but struggled for a long time to find another fortress (the original I had found was very small and lacked any brewing ingredients), my travels led me into a bastion, which I felt like I could take on in full diamond armor right?\u0026hellip; anyway I got 2 shot by a axe dude. Thankfully I had taken down the coordinates for this place before I died, and managed to recover my stuff being a tactical retreat (I ran away).\nEventually I did manage to find a nether fortress!.. which in typical minecraft fashion was right near my nether portal, just a lot lower and hidden by trees. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t mad though, I was honestly just happy to have found one and to have it easy to travel to, I battled some blazes and gathered the materials necessary to start doing some brewing in the overworld! Back on the garden grind! Okay time to relax! I had done my nether adventure and now I wanted to spend some time working on the garden! but first I needed some materials! luckily I had noted the coordinates for a lush cave many sessions ago so I headed over there to see what I could get! the cave ended up being rather small, but there were still enough resources there to make the trip worth it! When I returned home I worked on integrating some of these new materials into my garden, and adding some more components, another set of flower beds! and bees!! Some cherry blossoms between the 2 shelters were a nice touch, and a practical place to put some bee boxes as the bees could go between the flower beds! made the whole place feel a bit more alive. It was starting to get a bit annoying going from the garden to my main house every time I wanted some more dirt or foliage, so I decided to build a little garden shed in the garden! I also added a little pond. Horses! While I had been working on the garden I decided that I would very much like to breed the perfect horse! I have never done this before, but I knew it was possible and I thought it would be a really fun project, Spoiler alert: I have not done the breed the perfect horse part yet, but I did build a set of stables and a single horse unit carved into the garden retaining wall near my house to house my main horse! I could not have these empty though so I did go ahead and tame one horse, their name is Dusty! This stable is my own design I came up with in creative mode, however I did take some loose inspiration for the front facades of the build from this reddit post so go ahead and check it out if you like!\nAn update from the trading floor! We are coming to the end of this catch up post, but first a few things of note from the villager trading hall, I have been slowly working on gaining additional villagers trades in between all the other tasks I have been doing in this post, and also set up a simple villager zombifier, this system is okay but is not without it\u0026rsquo;s flaws, I will likely work on making an automatic system eventually. I am not going to recount every trade that I got here, but as you can see from this screenshot I did get a lot of them. I also set up some fletcher villagers to trade sticks for emeralds with, to complement this I set up a little auto bamboo farm, 2 actually, one at home and one in the spawn chunks to be always loaded While working on the spawn chunks one I learnt that Mojang had decreased the size of the spawn chunks to a 3x3 for performance reasons, however the absolute legends have also added a game rule that allows you to change the radius, I will likely end up using this game rule just once to set it back to what it was prior to this update as making it any larger than that would feel slightly cheaty (only for myself, you reader please do whatever you want in your own world).\nWith these trades avalible I was able to start making myself some nicer gear! Yearning for the mines! The main cave I dig in had been starting to run dry, thankfully there was another one open from the ground nearby, I went in, travelled very deep inside, found a lot of iron, got loaded up with resources, and got destroyed by an army of skeletons! I had never been in this cave before and not even left any torches so I was pretty ready to say goodbye to the gear and resources I had on me, but I wanted to at least try to find it, so I headed back in, and despite the endless amounts of turns, managed to trace my way back to my stuff pretty easily, playing minecraft without a mini map or waypoint map installed has genuinely improved my sense of direction! I also discovered on my way out that this new cave actually connects to my current one! via a massive ledge very far up, so that was a cool discovery.\nEnding notes that pretty much brings us to the end of this update, just a couple things I had not mentioned that you may have mentioned in screenshots:\nI at some stage built a bridge over the pond for future expansions. I gathered the materials to make a couple of ender chests for extra storage on the go. I started work building a mossy path that runs throughout the garden. And finally, I updated the world to minecraft version 1.21.8 (I skipped 1.21.7) That\u0026rsquo;s it for this post! thankyou for reading, here is a nice shot of how my base is currently looking to end on!

After arriving at the village I waited out the night, and then got to work getting a few villagers in a boat, and attaching them to the ghast, the experience was still a little fiddley, but over far better than my prior experiences using portals and boats. Transporting the villagers was still a slow process (after all the happy ghast is known more for it\u0026rsquo;s looks than it\u0026rsquo;s speed), but it was a FAR quicker process than the alternatives. when I arrived home I gave the villagers somewhere safe to stay and started working on a breeder.\nIncreasing the population! In prior playthrough\u0026rsquo;s I would often construct a villagers breeder and then create some kind of cosmetic shell around it to make it look a bit better, however I always found that when I did this is looked at the very least a little tacky. So I decided that this time I wanted to build the breeder underground, and then place a more pleasing building with access above it. So my first order or business was to dig a large hole! I treated myself to some diamond tools during the process, realistically I should be saving these for a full enchanted set, but I am in no rush, and the cave below my house is swimming with diamonds that I am saving for when I get a fortune pick.\nWith the hole dug I got to work creating the villager breeder, prior to this session I had spent some time in a creative world working on how I wanted it to look, as for the mechanics of how the farm works, I followed this tutorial by \u0026ldquo;moretingz\u0026rdquo; on YouTube, it was by far one of the quickest and most concise minecraft farm tutorials I have followed, I high recommend it to anyone wanting a new breeder design. Once I was done getting the breeder working it was time to work on the building on top, as this was a location I would be visiting when I want more villagers for my town, I thought a travel agency might be a fun theme to go with. I placed down a basic building which I plan to fill with maps and such later in my playthrough. Maybe not my prettiest build yet, but there is room for it to grow and become a nice spot in my town.\nTrading hall With the ability to gain more villagers whenever I needed secured, it was time to have a place for them to work! in other minecraft playthroughs I would typically construct a structure that looked something like this: It is a very convinient design and does not cost many resources, however for this world and this location I wanted something a bit more themed, I wanted to build a large trading hall and fill it with little \u0026ldquo;markets\u0026rdquo; where I could set up different types of villagers, they would still need containment in similar systems, but it would be inside a themed build.\nAfter spending a bit of time in a creative world designing, I had a trading hall build I was quite proud of, checking back in my survival world I saw that I needed to clear a bit of land to make it fit, and on that land was bees! I did not feel like properly setting up a greenhouse or anything for them yet, but I also did not want to get rid of them, so I transported them over to near my farm and gave them to flowers to keep them occupied. I finished getting the land cleared and carved in a connection to my path, I allowed it to get offset a little rather than being perfectly straight, on this scale I think it looks quite pleasing. With the canvas clear and some materials in my inventory it was time to get building! I will be honest, this was not a quick process, the building itself did not take too long, but the time spent gathering materials was a real bottleneck, I planted and cut down countless spruce trees during this process. Thankfully I designed this build with a limited block palette using materials I knew I could acquire in bulk easily, which definitely helped. With the build done all I needed to do was setup an easy way to get villagers in the hall, the building was large enough that I knew whatever mechanism I set up to transport the villagers was going to be around for quite a while, so I wanted it to be at least somewhat pleasing. I ended up with a simple no thrills underground rail system with a redstone trail leading to the dispenser in the breeder from the trading hall, it was simple and it does the job nicely. With the transportation system in I requested my first villager, got him setup, and did my first trade of this playthrough! Now I am not incredibly versed with the backend mechanics of minecraft so I am unsure if it was the trading hall. the breeder, or simply the presence of villagers in my town, but I do know that one of those things has classified my town as a village, which as I found out means that I now receive zombie hoards! I dispatched of them, unfortunately no fun banner to hang up and show I survived this like you get from the pillager raids, but I may still come up with some system to track these. after this I climbed my handy stay case to the top of the nearby mountain and had a look down on my town to see the progress I had made, The trading hall definitely sticks out due mostly to the the size of the thing, but I think it will look more at home once more structures are next to it. The process of filling this trading hall will be an ongoing one and I will not be updating on each new villager- that would be no fun for any of us, however I will write about the important ones in the blog posts. for now I got a little corner set up and did some decoration to mark what kind of items were behind sold by the villagers there, as a concept I think it works quite nicely. Spawn chunks! By this point I was feeling satisfied with the villagers and wanted to move on to something else for a bit before I got burnt out on it (trying to get specific villager trades has a real way of tiring you out so I want to drag this process out and do it bit by bit). I Intend to build some automatic farms for this world, especially later on, and the best place to do that is the spawn chunks as they are always loaded no matter where in your minecraft world you are!\nLocating these chunks is dead easy in newer versions of the game as you spawn right around world 0, so It\u0026rsquo;s easy to head over there and mark the spawn area. I built a little pillar to mark the exact 0 point, the I set up a good old fashioned nether portal link between my home base and the spawn chunks (remember, 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld) Thoughts on farms and final progress I am unsure exactly which kinds of farms I want in this world, I definitely want an iron farm at the moment, however it is possible that such an influx of iron will make me feel less motivated to go mining. In the current state and plans I have for this world I feel it will not cause me issues (I am going to need a lot in order to create some of my future plans, and I do not want playing on the world to start feeling like a chore). I think the best play is to simply play it by ear, I will make the farms I want, and if I decide they are cheapening the experience- I will shut down the farms and throw the items into lava- I mean it, if it makes the game less fun it\u0026rsquo;s going, but for now I am looking forward to setting up some farms.\nThis pretty much brings us to the end of this blog post, the only other thing I have done is worked on some basic decoration, got a couple of useful librarian villagers (mending and efficiency), and treated myself to an efficiency V diamond axe, which after all the tree chopping I have done so far in this play through, is a real luxury that I will be getting much use from! I will need to come up with some fun names for my enchanted tools once I start working on a proper set! but until next time, I hope you enjoyed this update on Alumantia, and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in the next post when I start doing- something (probably farms) thanks for reading!\nYou can read the whole Tales from Alumantia series here\n","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/tales-from-alumantia-pt.4---barter--buildings/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"an-airborne-expedition\"\u003eAn Airborne Expedition\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter acquiring my first happy ghast in my last session, my first goal was to head back to the village I had found earlier and transport some willing participants to their new home, along the way I got some fantastic view of the world gen.\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.4%20-%20Barter%20\u0026%20Buildings-20250702195040549.png\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.4%20-%20Barter%20\u0026%20Buildings-20250702195054877.png\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.4%20-%20Barter%20\u0026%20Buildings-20250702195138262.png\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.4%20-%20Barter%20\u0026%20Buildings-20250702195151575.png\"\u003e\nAfter arriving at the village I waited out the night, and then got to work getting a few villagers in a boat, and attaching them to the ghast, the experience was still a little fiddley, but over far better than my prior experiences using portals and boats.\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.4%20-%20Barter%20\u0026%20Buildings-20250702195309751.png\"\u003e\nTransporting the villagers was still a slow process (after all the happy ghast is known more for it\u0026rsquo;s looks than it\u0026rsquo;s speed), but it was a FAR quicker process than the alternatives. when I arrived home I gave the villagers somewhere safe to stay and started working on a breeder.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Tales from Alumantia Pt.4 - Barter \u0026 Buildings"},{"content":"Eyes on some new transport With my goal finding a village complete, it was time to re-focus my attention of transport, often my transportation of these villagers would involve:\nBoats Nether portals Buckets of water A lot of patience. However, as I mentioned in my last post I had recently updated to minecraft version 1.21.6, which among other things contained the happy ghast, and one awesome feature of these friendly flying creatures is the ability to attach a boat to them using leads, this feels like the perfect early game method for transporting villagers!\nI started with a trek back to my base, I was very happy to once again see my lookout tower serving as an excellent landmark to guide me back to home. On my way back I stumbled on a ruined portal, and amongst other items found a lodestone When I got home I threw together a quick farm using some carrots and potatoes I had \u0026ldquo;borrowed\u0026rdquo; from the village, I then used some of my diamonds from my last post to craft a diamond pick, headed down to the mines, acquired some obsidian (which was painfully slow with an un-enchanted pick) and got a portal setup! For now this portal would live just below my house to the side of the staircase that leads down to my mine, however I would soon construct a building for it.\nTo the nether! I gathered some food and went in to the nether to explore, the portal spawn I got is not the worst I have seen by any means, but it is certainly a bit crowded and hard to explore, I think a nether hub will be in order later down the line. I mined away and built bridges and found a few cool items including a snazzy pair of golden leggings with mending, this will help keep the piglins away! My goal was to find a soul sand biome as I had been told that the dried ghasts- a required component for spawning a happy ghast, could be found there, however I was only able to find some small ones in my initial search, with no dried ghasts in sight. I found out later I could also craft them, but didn\u0026rsquo;t end up needing to. I found a fortress! And\u0026hellip;. had my first significant death Should have seen it coming, every new world I forget just show squishy you actually are without a set of high tier armour.\nHome improvement! I will be back here to reclaim my gear eventually, however after this defeat I decided to slow down a little and recoup some resources and expand my base a bit before taking another trip into the nether.\nI did some mining, found an abandoned mine shaft, got reequipped, and was visited by my first raiding party! How exciting! I will collect their banners here for now: I searched the nearby hills for some cows to farm, bought those over with some wheat I had been growing, quadrupled the size of my crop farm, added a section for cows, and visited a nearby clearing and collected some flowers to decorate the outside of my house- now this is minecraft! I got up on the nearby hill which housed my lookout, and got myself a nice birds eye view of my base, it gave me a good idea of where I would like to place future buildings. I have decided that for this play though- at least in the early game, I would like to have a few separate buildings for things, rather than just 1 large base that contains everything, this takes a bit more work but feels more satisfying at least to me. Important side note! I found peonies, which are my favourite minecraft flower! Looking around the room in my house that had essentially become my bedroom, I felt I found it a bit simple and empty, at this time my partner (who I was on the phone with while playing) suggested adding an aquarium, I really liked this idea but due to how I had constructed the room was not sure which wall to put it on- so I decided to dig one into the floor! Trust the process! it\u0026rsquo;s gonna look great. This new project led me to wanting some kelp to help with decoration and creating full water sources quickly, so I grabbed a boat and went exploring, this was not the quickest search but it did lead me towards an awesome looking ice spikes biome and a cold ocean where I was able to scoop up some kelp, at some point I hope to find a warm ocean for coral and such, but I will need a silk touch pick before then anyway. back home I added this to the tank, covered it in glass, filled it up, and added a couple salmon to fill the place of tropical fish that I will eventually add. In another search for a warm ocean I did stumble on some tropical areas, and this is where I witnessed biome mob variations for the first time, I kept my cool and definitely did not have a 2 minute freak out over how adorable this cow was. I also found a few tropical fish here but did not get a screenshot of them, they are in my tank though.\nI went home and decided it was time to create a stair case leading up to my lookout. I then got to work on a building to contain my nether portal and other magic stuff, this was my second attempt (no screenshots of the first one but it was just a box) this second attempt was a box- with offset sides! I\u0026rsquo;m really enjoying this style of building where it is almost a square but with a 1 block offset along the walls, it adds a lot and in the case of the magic building allowed me to create a nice groove that would perfectly fit a portal and enchanting table, you will see this a bit later.\nAs I was taking the above screenshots I noticed I had been visited by another raiding party! the last one must have left a good review All this time I had been gradually increasing the amount of cows in my farm, which I would soon need for the bookshelves for my enchanting setup. To the nether! - again I was quite happy with all the improvements I had made, and with the new and improved nether portal housing, I was feeling ready to give the nether another go!\nI went in, exploring in a different direction to last time, and after some searching, I spotted fossils sticking out of the ground! I rushed over and sure enough, I found my first ever dried ghast! A new friend 1 quick YouTube tutorial later, I had my happy ghast rehydrating at home! I went to a nearby(ish) snow biome and got some snowballs to feed to this beautiful creature once he was done hydrating, I then did a few odd jobs (mostly chest sorting) as I waited the 20 minutes for my new friend to rehydrate. There he is!! don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled- he is not far away, just very small, this would not last long however as I had many snowballs to give him! I was very excited to say the least, I named him Gregory, this is important information. I made Gregory a harness and found him a place to live! I was very happy to finally have a happy ghast, and I must say after flying around a bit, Mojang have found a fantastic way to provide flight to the player in the early game, without disrupting the pacing of the game, or remove the desire for an elytra. This is about where I finished this set of sessions, only other thing I did was get some some more of the magic house interior done. Other than that, that\u0026rsquo;s about it for this post!

I know I know, mods have been doing this for years (trust me I\u0026rsquo;ve installed them many times), but there was something about seeing this little diorama in my vanilla playthrough that just made me happy.\nLaying the foundation when I was done with my brief exploration I got to work chopping trees, I was sure to replant them as I want, as I am unsure what I want to do with this area yet and thus would like to keep it mostly as is for now. With a nice little stockpile of logs I got to work on the first structure of my starter base! which was not a house, or a shack, or a farm\u0026hellip; but a dock! Admittedly a random thing to start with, but I was in love with the pond and wanted to establish how my builds would connect to it, so I started with a dock and some paths leading from it, I used these as guides later.\nI slept on the dock for a few nights as I gathered resources, I then started laying down a proper little house for myself, I did not have huge visions for this, I just needed somewhere to sleep, craft, and store my things in a less chaotic manor than a chest pile. I used no tutorial (or even reference in this case) for this house, I wanted to just build freely the way I would have in my early minecrafting days, and I was quite pleased with how the freestyle house was turning out, but I wanted some spruce wood for my room to break things up a little, so I took an adventure to go find some, aswell as exploring some other biomes. I was quite happy to see that my lookout building from last time was serving as a rather excellent beacon to use for a sense of direction. I explored some biomes on my way, including this new white one? that\u0026rsquo;s been added since the last time I played vanilla minecraft, I dig it. my expedition for spruce saplings was a success! though more dangerous than I expected, it is easy to forget that at the start of a hard more playthrough when all you have is a stone sword and no armour- that the mobs are actually quite a challenge, I will need to address that soon.\nI made it home and planted the whole 2 saplings I escaped with while running from skeletons, I figured they would eventually give me more saplings- they did not after many growths, not sure if they have changed how sapling drops work, or if I just got unlucky- probably the later. Never the less I eventually built up enough spruce to build my roof This was where I left it for this session, but there is more to come before this post is over.\nThe next day If I was not clear about it in my post 0 explaining this format, not each session will be it\u0026rsquo;s own blog post, that sounds tiring, and frankly likely a bit boring once we get into later sessions, instead these posts serve as recaps from all sessions between my last blog post and this one (exceptions will be made where they seem fit).\nThe next day before I got back on I updated my world to minecraft version 1.21.6, the first update of this play through! I decided that I wanted to mark each update the world went through, I had nowhere more grand to do so for the moment so until I build something nicer, I will keep these updates in my mine entrance room Into the mines! At this stage I was feeling motivated and wanted to start getting equipped with something stronger than stone, it was time to mine! A couple of deaths to fall damage did occur, however over all I would call the expedition a resounding success! It appears I have build my home right over a large cave network, one that appeared at first to be just a small cavern, go me!\nI made 2 trips, one down initially to get some iron, then after taking the iron upstairs and processing it into some gear, I headed down again with my sights set higher! The caverns below my house were expansive, and loaded with resources, I certainly walked away from this with far more diamonds than I had hoped for, I was aiming for enough for a pickaxe.\nI had plenty of food with me so I decided to keep exploring this cave as far as it would go, as it turned out the cavern I went down went very far, so far in fact that I ended up back above ground through an exit I found. I emerged from the cave thinking I must be so far from home, I turned around to see if I could locate my lookout, or at least the mountain it was on, just to see that I had merged no more than a couple hundred blocks from home! I got to work smelting my ores, and while they were smelting I chopped some more trees and starting filling in the chest room in my house, I want this place to be able to support me for a while so I left room for a decent collection of chests, I will be working on a basic category system for these as I play, I one day want to build a large redstone item sorter, but that will be a much larger and much later project. A village to pillage trade with At this stage I felt ready for some adventure! and wanted to get to work on locating a village for future projects, I had not seen one in this world yet and wanted to locate one sooner rather than later. so I set out, finding a few choice locations on the way, including a woodland mansion, which I have saved the coordinates to but will be doing at a later date, I have actually never done a woodland mansion (always kind of ignored them) so I am excited to give it a go once I gear up a little better.\nIt took traveling some distance - really quite a long distance, but I eventually managed to locate a village, and I was in luck! it was not abandoned! I helped myself to a few hay bales and assisted a few of the villagers in staying nice and warm inside their houses, it\u0026rsquo;s for their safety really. At this stage I was thinking about how time consuming it was going to be to transport these villagers to their new home, until I remembered why I was so excited for this particular update- the happy ghast! for those familiar with the new mob I am sure to know what I will be doing with it, as for everyone else, I will explain in my next post, but for now, this is where my last session ended.\nThankyou for reading, in my next session I plan to get myself a working nether portal and get to work on getting myself a happy ghast!

Some classic childhood parental begging occurred - a joint effort between me and my older brother, and some time later they agreed to buy an account for the 2 of us to share (best day ever, thanks mum and dad).\nThis version of the game was special as not only would it receive all future updates at no additional payment, but it contained Survival mode, if memory serves, I had a couple of survival worlds across different minecraft updates, however at some stage I started playing on just the one survival world across all updates, and this was my \u0026ldquo;forever world\u0026rdquo; which I played in whenever I could, including update features as they came, I remember I had a furnace minecart railway that led to an island near the main land I did all my building, which I named \u0026ldquo;redstone island\u0026rdquo; when a the redstone update was released later and I used it for all of my redstone testing. I went on to play on this world for many years, however it met a \u0026ldquo;tragic\u0026rdquo; end as the old family laptop I played on got a virus, and the world could not be recovered.\nThe in between I was saddened by the loss of my forever world, however I still played the game often, though around this time I turned to playing modpacks more often, some of the modpacks I look back on fondly include the \u0026ldquo;technic\u0026rdquo; modpack (not to be confused with \u0026ldquo;tekkit\u0026rdquo;, which I also played and loved), the hexxit modpack, and others that were available across the FTB launcher and technic platform launcher.\nAs largely a modded player I was no longer playing version of minecraft as they released, I was often on which ever version was most popular for modding at the time, i distinctly remember 1.7.10 to 1.12 being a large jump I a large jump in modpack version popularity. I did of course still play on these vanilla updates to the game in smaller worlds, and later on servers my friends hosted, however never to the same degree of \u0026ldquo;forever world\u0026rdquo; that I had with my original world.\nI continued to play minecraft for a long time, all the way through primary and high school, and continue to play it today (with notably large breaks from the game as is regular for most long term hobbies I\u0026rsquo;m sure.)\nToday Today (or rather yesterday night) I have found myself deciding to start a new world, a forever world once again, I had considered starting this world in an earlier version of the game to recapture some of the charm of older terrain meeting new terrain, but have decided that a playthrough on the latest version of the game will feel the most organic as time goes on. in this play through I will only use client side modes like sodium and oculus for performance and visuals, but I am avoiding mini-map mods and things of that nature as I am trying to recapture some of the simplicity of minecraft.\nI have decided it might be fun to document my playthrough a little, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel super keen on creating a let\u0026rsquo;s play or anything as it is a lot of additional work for what is just a hobby, but a blog post every now and then just catching up on what I have been doing in the world sounds nice.\nYou can read the whole Tales from Alumantia series here\n","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/tales-from-alumantia-pt.0---starting-a-forever-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis feels like a silly thing to blog, but that has never stopped me before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy early days of playing minecraft were spent playing a free light weight creative only version of the game through a web browser, a version that is today known as \u003ca href=\"https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Classic\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;minecraft classic\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, some time later (bare in mind I was around the age of 8 or 9 years old at this time and my memory of the passing of time from then is not fantastic) a newer version of minecraft of the game was announced, one that would require a paid account (This version of the game is called \u003ca href=\"https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Indev\"\u003eIndev\u003c/a\u003e).

The visuals of sprawling lush landscape and intensified by the shader pack I am using, The \u0026ldquo;Complementary shaders - unbound\u0026rdquo;, I am a huge fan of this shader pack as I find it delivers not only stellar performance (I see my framerate hovering between 150-160fps) but I also find that it delivers moody but clear visuals at night time and inside dark caves, where as some other shader packs I have used look great with lots of light, but strain my eyes by making things too dark. Admittedly the high performance I experience with these shaders is partially accredited to the specs of my PC, but I have found that these shaders set to lower settings can still produce very playable framerates on my laptop, which is of lower specs.\nAfter I was done admiring my surroundings I went straight to the nearby patch of cherry blossom trees to acquire some wood and saplings, this is my favourite tree that has been added to the game thus far. I explored for a small time before finding that one of the nearby mountains had a giant flat surface at the top, with an absolutely breathtaking view of the surrounding area. This would be where I setup for my first few nights in the game, with a fantastic view to plan development in the surrounding areas.\nI mined some of the hill sides for resources and politely asked a few sheep and cows for their meat, before throwing together a quick starter house as it quickly darkened. Here was my house for night 1, it\u0026rsquo;s not beautiful, but it beats a dirt shack (just about). On my second day I got to work chopping trees, I started building what I had planned to be the bedroom for my new starter base, with a great lookout over the surrounding biomes, however my few trips up and down the mountain during this process led me to decide that any frequent access location built up here should be made for later in the playthrough when I have access to an elytra, so I continued to build the room, but more as a lookout rather than a house. I did temporarily move my bed and some other things into this lookout (beats the night 1 house), however this is short term until I make a new place. The view from the lookout is perfect, and I captured a rather pleasing view of the virtual sunset. One thing I did discover while exploring my mountain top was a wonderful clearing with a picturesque lake down the opisite side of the mountain to spawn, I feel confident that this is where I will set up my new starter base when I next play. This is about the end of my first session in this world, spare for a little more mining and building a modest farm and setting up a few chests. And that\u0026rsquo;s it! definitely a smaller session (I was tired) but a nice start for sure, next time I play I will be exploring the clearing I showed above and setting up a proper starter base to with some storage.\nYou can read the whole Tales from Alumantia series here\n","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/tales-from-alumantia-pt.1---a-fresh-start/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWorld seed for those interested:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSeed: -1412583731547517931\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-world-begins\"\u003eThe world begins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpawning in and taking a look around, I am immediately greeted by some absolutely stunning visuals, giving me an even deeper appreciation for the work that has been done by Mojang on the world generation system, I may be very nostalgic for the old beta style terrain, but this new system is beautiful.\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.1%20-%20A%20fresh%20start.png\"\u003eThe visuals of sprawling lush landscape and intensified by the shader pack I am using, The \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/complementary-unbound\"\u003eComplementary shaders - unbound\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;, I am a huge fan of this shader pack as I find it delivers not only stellar performance (I see my framerate hovering between 150-160fps) but I also find that it delivers moody but \u003cstrong\u003eclear\u003c/strong\u003e visuals at night time and inside dark caves, where as some other shader packs I have used look great with lots of light, but strain my eyes by making things too dark.\n\u003cimg alt=\"Image Description\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/LachiesLibrary/images/Tales%20from%20Alumantia%20Pt.1%20-%20A%20fresh%20start-20250618162840196.png\"\u003e\nAdmittedly the high performance I experience with these shaders is partially accredited to the specs of \u003ca href=\"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-home-pc-setup/\"\u003emy PC\u003c/a\u003e, but I have found that these shaders set to lower settings can still produce very playable framerates on my laptop, which is of lower specs.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Tales from Alumantia Pt.1 - A fresh start"},{"content":"Intro If you are reading this then chances are you are a brand new (or returning) D\u0026amp;D player, welcome to the table! What is to follow is my attempt to condense down all essential first time D\u0026amp;D knowledge into a simple and easy to follow guide. Just remember, the best way to learn D\u0026amp;D is by playing it! So make a character, learn what you can about gameplay, and any gaps in your knowledge will be filled as you play!\nIf you wish to gain a high level overview of the game before any further reading, I recommend you watch this video by Ginny Di on YouTube, it is intended for people using the 2024 rules so a few words are slightly different however pretty much all of the explanation of how the game is played is the same.\nTechnical Info My D\u0026amp;D games use the D\u0026amp;D 5e (2014) ruleset, This is not to be confused with the D\u0026amp;D 5.5e (2024) ruleset, It is easy to set D\u0026amp;D beyond to use the 2014 rules only so that you do not need to worry about it, I will go over this when I talk about D\u0026amp;D beyond later. What is D\u0026amp;D / How do I play? High level D\u0026amp;D Description D\u0026amp;D Is a TTRPG (Table top roleplaying game), Which is to say that you play the game by sitting around a table narrating your actions. In the case of D\u0026amp;D there are 2 types of players;\nPlayer characters Dungeon master A dungeon master is responsible for narrating the overall story, controlling NPCs (non-player characters), and overall running the game. A Player character (That\u0026rsquo;s you!) is responsible for controlling and narrating the actions of their individual character. Actions as a player character As a player you can essentially break down everything you do into 2 categories:\nOut of combat When out of combat, players are free to perform various actions at will, these actions include but are not limited to:\ntraveling from location to location (often within a town or settlement) speaking with NPCs (the player speaks as themselves and the DM speaks as the NPC the player is talking to) Bartering (functions the same as speaking with NPCs) exploring locations (either publicly or by sneaking around, this often includes skill checks which we will talk about later) Performing other miscellaneous actions. Some of these actions will require skill checks to perform, while others are just assumed possible, we will talk about skill checks later. In combat During combat the game becomes turn based, The order of turns is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll of a D20 + plus your initiative modifier (we will speak about modifiers later when we speak about skill checks). I will explain combat further in one of the next sections.\nThe Dice! If you know nothing else about D\u0026amp;D you will likely at least know 1 thing - there are lots of dice! these dice like in any game are used for generating random numbers, these numbers include the damage of weapons, the amount of heath regained by drinking a potion, etc. every item, spell, and weapon that involves a dice roll specifies which one it needs by identifying the die as a \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; followed by the number of sides, for example a 6 sided die is referred to as a \u0026ldquo;D6\u0026rdquo;, a 12 sided die is referred to as a \u0026ldquo;D12\u0026rdquo; etc. Notes:\n0 = maximum value: You will notice that the D10 has a 0 on it, it is important to note that this 0 actually represents 10. The D100: there will be times where you DM, or a class feature ask you to roll a \u0026ldquo;D100\u0026rdquo; you will notice that there is no 100 sided die in a standard set of dice. this roll is actually done by rolling the D10 along with the percentile die, adding the resulting numbers together. It is important to note that when rolling a D100 the 0 actually represents 0 instead of maximum value, unless you roll entirely 0s, in which case you have rolled a perfect 100 Multiple Dice: sometimes a weapon, spell, etc. Will call for rolling multiple dice, they will list this by writing the Number followed by the type, for example: 3D6 means roll 3 six sided dice. You do not need to buy any! if you have your own that you want to bring then that is totally encouraged! however I have plenty of spare dice for you to borrow if you like :)\nSkill checks / Saving throws At this stage I have mentioned skill checks a couple times, D\u0026amp;D contains a series of skills used to attempt various tasks (Acrobatics, Deception, Stealth, etc.) every character has a modifier (sometimes positive, sometimes neutral, sometimes negative) for each of these skills listed on their character sheet, these are determined during the character creation process (more on that later).\nTo perform a skill check, roll a D20, and add your modifier for the relevant skill, for example if your DM asks you to make a stealth check, then you roll a D20, and apply your stealth modifier to the result of the roll; After you roll your skill check and add the modifier you tell your DM the final number, they will then tell you if you failed or succeeded in what you were trying to do. It is important to note that in order to make a skill check to attempt something you must first be asked / approved to do so. for example you may say that you want to try and break down a door, your DM will ask you to make a strength check (for example), then you will do it and say the result. You can not however simply roll a strength check without asking and then say \u0026ldquo;hey I wanna knock down the door also I rolled a 16\u0026rdquo;, the reasoning for this will become clear as you play the game, but it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about keeping discussions / options clear as well as giving your DM the opportunity to tell you that you can not do something / give your fellow players the chance you talk you out of it.\nIf you wish to accomplish a task in a certain way then you can request the specific skill check, for example if you want to get through a door by picking the lock, you can specifically ask your DM \u0026ldquo;Hey I want to try and get through this door, can I make a slight of hand check to try picking the lock on the door\u0026rdquo;. Requests like this will feel more natural to you as you keep playing the game, but at the start it is totally fine to just say \u0026ldquo;hey I want to try and get through this door\u0026rdquo; and let your DM tell you what check to make.\nYou should also note that not every action in the game requires a skill check, for example if you want to just pick up a simple object or walk across a room for example, you just say that you do it, no check required. If you feel unsure as to if you can perform an action, just say that you try to do it and the DM will tell you if a check is required, you will get a feel for it as you play.\nSaving throws function the exact same way to skill checks, the only difference is that it is typically called a skill check when proactively trying to do something, while it is typically called a saving throw when reacting to something. For example you may make a dexterity skill check to try and throw something at someone, while that someone may make a dexterity saving throw to try and dodge it. The mechanics are exactly the same, just different words and they often get interchanged.\nCritical hits / success (natural 20) and critical miss / failure (natural 1) have different effects depending on your DM, you can read about how they work in my games in my D\u0026amp;D house rules.\nCombat! Okay so It\u0026rsquo;s time to go more in depth on how combat works, I will break this up into sections including how it starts, what you can do during combat, how battle maps work, and how combat ends.\nHow combat starts Combat can be initiated by the players or by NPCs, it is often started either with an act of violence (either by the players or to the players) or by simply declaring it with words, you will know that combat has officially started when your DM tells you \u0026ldquo;roll initiative\u0026rdquo; when this happens, roll a D20 and add your initiative modifier to it, this bonus is listed on your characters sheet. Once you have your initiative score, do your DM a very kind favour and rather than calling it out at the same time as everyone else, hold on to it and wait while they go around the table and ask for it (they will love you). The order of turns in combat is determined by taking everyone\u0026rsquo;s initiative roll (both the player\u0026rsquo;s and the NPC\u0026rsquo;s) and listing them from highest to lowest (your DM will do this).\nWhat to do on your turn There are 3 things a player can do on their turn, which can be done in any order, these 3 things are: Move, Take an action, And take a bonus action. I will detail each of these below.\nAction You action can be seen as the main part of your turn, it is typically used for making an attack or casting a spell, however you may choose to use your action to hide, help another player, etc. I will just be explaining how attacks and spells work, but you can find a full list of what you can do with your action here\nMaking an attack To make an attack, you first need to\nchoose a weapon / damage dealing spell from your character sheet, and then an enemy that is within range (range is either determined by asking your DM how close they are in the case of playing in \u0026ldquo;theatre of the mind\u0026rdquo; or by counting squares if playing on a battle mat, more on that later).\nyou then roll a D20 and apply your attack modifier, this can be found by next to the weapon on your character sheet This is just like making a skill check except you use the attack modifier for the weapon you are using rather than the modifier from a skill, once your have your final number tell the DM what it is, they will then tell you if it hit or if it missed.( If the attack missed then your main action is over, you still have your bonus action and movement though! if you have not used them already)\nIf your attack hit then you roll damage! the damage is listed next to the attack modifier, weapon damage is listed in the following format:\nAmount of dice | Type of Dice | Additional modifier.\nExamples: 1d4+4 = Roll one 4 sided die, add 4 to the result. 2d6+3 = Roll two 6 sided dice, add them together, add 3 to the result. 3d10+5 = Roll three ten sided dice, add them together, add 5 to the result etc.\nIt is important to note that when rolling damage for a spell that uses multiple dice, you only get the damage bonus once, regardless of the amount of dice, so if you are rolling 2d4+2, you only add that +2 after add the two D4 results together, not once for each die, there are certain exceptions to this rule for attacks that hit the target multiple times, such as eldritch blast.\nTell your DM how much damage you ended up with, and what type of damage it was (this is also listed on the attack right next to the damage amount) The DM will then subtract the amount of damage you did from your targets hit points (you do not get to see the enemies hit points, but the DM will tell you when they die)\nMaking a character ","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/dd-essential-knowledge---a-quick-start-guide-for-brand-new-dd-players-in-my-games/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are reading this then chances are you are a brand new (or returning) D\u0026amp;D player, welcome to the table!

The cloud sync hard drive: I use drop box for cloud storage for all my work, I enjoy the comfort of having a cloud backup and access to my files without remembering to bring a hard drive with me, however the one downside of using cloud storage can be waiting for files to sync, to remove this down side I have a 2TB m.2 (for high speed) SSD which I have my ENTIRE drop box account constantly syncing to, it may be seen as a little overkill, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s perfect, and offers the best of both worlds regarding cloud storage / working locally.

Wacom intous pro medium: this is the tablet to get! that said many alternatives from huion or others can also work great and be at least 80% as good. what is more important on a tablet hunt is to get one without a screen, I used to use a very large screen tablet, it was a good tablet and for someone doing a lot more 2D art it may be the better device, however for 3D art where tasks are often changing as you work through the pipeline, I found that the larger device took too long to get setup (even when being used as a monitor in it\u0026rsquo;s down time) and also provided worse ergonomics due to the neck needing to be craned down even a little bit when using it.

Google home: This lives on the desk so it is included on the list, it is good for some music and hands free controlling some home systems, it was also a birthday gift, I love it but would not recommend buying it for the purposes of making art. Network switch: good if you have a single cord running to your office / room and want a wired connection to few devices (in my case my main PC, my media PC, and a WIFI booster ) Placement fixings: I use these to secure items like the wireless charger and speaker stands to my desk, this comes in handy if you are a bit particular like me and want to make sure things will stay the safe after giving your setup a good clean.

During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything). take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine). the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife. it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises. place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap. leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours. if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount. Method - working with the dough preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius. line a pizza tray with baking paper. take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour. take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour. if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle. press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed. transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this). add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese. repeat for remaining dough balls. cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base.

What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.\nHow it started The idea to print out my own minis first came from seeing it on a YouTube video by “power word spill” on YouTube and I started out creating minis exactly as he recommended, sourcing art from the website printable heroes, printing and cutting, and using binder clips as a cheap and effective base. I found a bulk packet of binder clips on amazon and also found some relatively cheap card stock as I wanted to make sure the minis did not feel flimsy – regular printer paper was not quite going to cut it.\nMy first test As you can see the results were decent, however the print quality (which I later found out was my printer running low on ink) left something to be desired, but the concept was there.\nAt this stage I want to point out that I did do one thing differently to the defined method for making these minis, I used my die cutting machine to cut the mini rather than a craft knife, I left this out earlier as I do not want anyone reading to think they need a die cutting machine to create these minis – a craft knife and a little patience will absolutely do it! I just already had a machine for other craft projects and wanted to get some extra use out of it. The process of making these on the machine was easy, I just opened the PDF from printable heroes in photoshop (you could do this for free in a program like krita), and isolated the image I wanted to print and cut.\nBut what about custom minis? this was all a great start, but what about minis we wanted to play with that did not have preexisting printable mini sheets just laying around on the internet, such as our own player characters or custom NPCs, or the DMs custom creatures? Well this is where a little more photoshop (or in this case affinity designer) came into play.\nBe it hand drawn, rendered, or something found on the internet, I needed to find a way to get any image ready to be printed and cut using the same method we had established for the art from printable heroes, to do this I started by isolating the art from the background in photoshop (ideally you start with some art without a background, but that is not always the case)\nWith the background isolated, it became a simple matter of using photoshop to generate an outline, adding a black semicircle as a guide for the base, then duplicating and flipping everything. I now had a printable mini.\n^ My character “Jacklyn” created in hero forge, screenshotted, background isolated in photoshop, and the final ready for print and cut version.\nThe Dry Erase Minis This is an idea I was very proud of, I took some generic character art and isolated it\u0026rsquo;s silhouette making it white, I then gave it the same ready to print treatment that I gave all the minis before this, however before folding them I covered them in some clear adhesive laminate, this left me with a handful of minis that the DM can use dry erase markers to quickly label on the fly for unexpected encounters.\nNotes \u0026amp; Final Results An important bit of wisdom shared by power word spill in his YouTube video is that you are better of making minis as you need them, rather than creating a bunch of minis that you may or may not end up needing in the future.\nmy personal advice to anyone wanting to try these out would be to create the following before your first session playing with minis:\nA copy of each NPC that could end up in combat THIS SESSION (no need to create NPCs your players will not meet, or ones that will never be in a fight). a handful of generic \u0026ldquo;bad guys\u0026rdquo; from your campaign setting, when in doubt, a few goblins and a few kobolds are a good place to start. a mini for each player character (if you can get some assorted ones, I recommend using binder clips of a different colour for player characters, it can really help speed up combat). a handful of blank minis for improvised encounters.

Resource tracking Ammo non magical or otherwise non-modified ammo is not tracked, if you have a bow and quiver with 20 arrows, it is assumed that you manage to retrieve them from the battlefield during / after combat. If combat reaches a point where you may have actually used all 20 arrows (rare) then I may tell you that your quiver has run dry - however you do not need to track this, I will. the same goes for crossbow bolts, slingshot ammo, etc.\nmagical or otherwise modified ammo is tracked, and is often consumed on use, for example a magical arrow that does an additional 1d6 frost damage, would either be destroyed, or converted back into a regular arrow after firing it. modified items such as poisoned darts can be collected but in their regular state, for example if you fired a poisoned dart at a creature, you could reclaim it after combat, but it would now be a regular dart.\nMisc Drinking a potion is a bonus action You may use your bonus action to consume a potion.
