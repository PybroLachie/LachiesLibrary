The cloud sync hard drive: I use drop box for cloud storage for all my work, I enjoy the comfort of having a cloud backup and access to my files without remembering to bring a hard drive with me, however the one downside of using cloud storage can be waiting for files to sync, to remove this down side I have a 2TB m.2 (for high speed) SSD which I have my ENTIRE drop box account constantly syncing to, it may be seen as a little overkill, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s perfect, and offers the best of both worlds regarding cloud storage / working locally.

I do however find it very helpful for controlling my virtual webcam during meetings and while running online classes, and as this list is for my entire setup, it is included. Wacom intous pro medium: this is the tablet to get! that said many alternatives from huion or others can also work great and be at least 80% as good. what is more important on a tablet hunt is to get one without a screen, I used to use a very large screen tablet, it was a good tablet and for someone doing a lot more 2D art it may be the better device, however for 3D art where tasks are often changing as you work through the pipeline, I found that the larger device took too long to get setup (even when being used as a monitor in it\u0026rsquo;s down time) and also provided worse ergonomics due to the neck needing to be craned down even a little bit when using it.

Google home: This lives on the desk so it is included on the list, it is good for some music and hands free controlling some home systems, it was also a birthday gift, I love it but would not recommend buying it for the purposes of making art. Network switch: good if you have a single cord running to your office / room and want a wired connection to few devices (in my case my main PC, my media PC, and a WIFI booster ) Placement fixings: I use these to secure items like the wireless charger and speaker stands to my desk, this comes in handy if you are a bit particular like me and want to make sure things will stay the safe after giving your setup a good clean. Knick-knack box: it\u0026rsquo;s a silly thing to recommend, but having a small box handy for USBs, trinkets, adapters, etc. can really help keep your space clear, for the couple dollars they go for its a huge recommend!

What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.\nHow it started The idea to print out my own minis first came from seeing it on a YouTube video by “power word spill” on YouTube and I started out creating minis exactly as he recommended, sourcing art from the website printable heroes, printing and cutting, and using binder clips as a cheap and effective base. I found a bulk packet of binder clips on amazon and also found some relatively cheap card stock as I wanted to make sure the minis did not feel flimsy – regular printer paper was not quite going to cut it.\nMy first test As you can see the results were decent, however the print quality (which I later found out was my printer running low on ink) left something to be desired, but the concept was there.\nAt this stage I want to point out that I did do one thing differently to the defined method for making these minis, I used my die cutting machine to cut the mini rather than a craft knife, I left this out earlier as I do not want anyone reading to think they need a die cutting machine to create these minis – a craft knife and a little patience will absolutely do it! I just already had a machine for other craft projects and wanted to get some extra use out of it. The process of making these on the machine was easy, I just opened the PDF from printable heroes in photoshop (you could do this for free in a program like krita), and isolated the image I wanted to print and cut.\nBut what about custom minis? this was all a great start, but what about minis we wanted to play with that did not have preexisting printable mini sheets just laying around on the internet, such as our own player characters or custom NPCs, or the DMs custom creatures? Well this is where a little more photoshop (or in this case affinity designer) came into play.\nBe it hand drawn, rendered, or something found on the internet, I needed to find a way to get any image ready to be printed and cut using the same method we had established for the art from printable heroes, to do this I started by isolating the art from the background in photoshop (ideally you start with some art without a background, but that is not always the case)\nWith the background isolated, it became a simple matter of using photoshop to generate an outline, adding a black semicircle as a guide for the base, then duplicating and flipping everything. I now had a printable mini.\n^ My character “Jacklyn” created in hero forge, screenshotted, background isolated in photoshop, and the final ready for print and cut version.\nThe Dry Erase Minis This is an idea I was very proud of, I took some generic character art and isolated it\u0026rsquo;s silhouette making it white, I then gave it the same ready to print treatment that I gave all the minis before this, however before folding them I covered them in some clear adhesive laminate, this left me with a handful of minis that the DM can use dry erase markers to quickly label on the fly for unexpected encounters.\nNotes \u0026amp; Final Results An important bit of wisdom shared by power word spill in his YouTube video is that you are better of making minis as you need them, rather than creating a bunch of minis that you may or may not end up needing in the future.\nmy personal advice to anyone wanting to try these out would be to create the following before your first session playing with minis:\nA copy of each NPC that could end up in combat THIS SESSION (no need to create NPCs your players will not meet, or ones that will never be in a fight). a handful of generic \u0026ldquo;bad guys\u0026rdquo; from your campaign setting, when in doubt, a few goblins and a few kobolds are a good place to start. a mini for each player character (if you can get some assorted ones, I recommend using binder clips of a different colour for player characters, it can really help speed up combat). a handful of blank minis for improvised encounters.

Resource tracking Ammo non magical or otherwise non-modified ammo is not tracked, if you have a bow and quiver with 20 arrows, it is assumed that you manage to retrieve them from the battlefield during / after combat. If combat reaches a point where you may have actually used all 20 arrows (rare) then I may tell you that your quiver has run dry - however you do not need to track this, I will. the same goes for crossbow bolts, slingshot ammo, etc.\nmagical or otherwise modified ammo is tracked, and is often consumed on use, for example a magical arrow that does an additional 1d6 frost damage, would either be destroyed, or converted back into a regular arrow after firing it. modified items such as poisoned darts can be collected but in their regular state, for example if you fired a poisoned dart at a creature, you could reclaim it after combat, but it would now be a regular dart.\nMisc Drinking a potion is a bonus action You may use your bonus action to consume a potion. You are still allowed to spend your main action on consuming a potion, however you may not consume more than 1 potion in 1 turn (no using your bonus action AND action to consume multiple potions).\n","permalink":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-dd-house-rules/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThese are the house rules I use when I run D\u0026amp;D, intended for use with D\u0026amp;D 5e (2014)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"critical-hit-and-failure\"\u003eCritical hit and failure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-combat\"\u003eIn Combat\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling a natural 20 will automatically hit whatever you were attacking, you double the amount of dice you would normally roll for damage (for example, if attacking with a dagger which does 1d4+2 damage normally, a natural 20 will do 2d4 + 2 damage).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling a natural 1 in combat will prevent the attack from hitting it\u0026rsquo;s target, depending on the circumstances the attack may simply miss, or it may backfire in a more spectacular way.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My D\u0026D House Rules"}]
