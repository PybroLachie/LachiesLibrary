<h1 id="welcome-to-lachies-library">Welcome to Lachie&rsquo;s Library!</h1>
<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>My name is Lachie, I am a professional 3D artist and game developer, with a bunch of other hobbies, including gaming, playing and running D&amp;D, world building, building computers, camping, cooking, and more. I created this website as a place to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects- The silly ones and the cool ones alike! along with some custom resources for various hobbies I have created and would like to share.</p>
<h3 id="why-make-a-website">Why make a website?</h3>
<p>I have always had a habit of developing random interests and hobbies that I tend to get very deep into rather quickly, some of these last for a few weeks, others a few months, and some I have been interested in and working on for over a decade now. throughout all these hobbies and interests I would often attempt to take notes and document my workflows, however for a long time I got stuck on trying to organise my thoughts, and the organisation and documentation became it&rsquo;s own fixation, one I found overwhelming, and often ended up doing poorly or not at all due to a lack of a proper system.</p>
<p>This all changed for me when I discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Obsidian</a>, A free markdown based note taking program that allowed me to shape my note taking system to be whatever I needed it to be, as well as learning about some popular &ldquo;<a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">second brain</a>&rdquo; methods including <a href="https://workflowy.com/systems/para-method/#:~:text=The%20system%20was%20developed%20by,work%20at%20his%20consulting%20job." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PARA</a> by Tiago Forte, and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=The%20Zettelkasten%20method%20was%20invented,system%2C%20dubbed%20the%20Zettelkasten%20method." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">zettelkasten</a> by Niklas Luhmann, both of which I use elements of in my own hybrid note taking system today.</p>
<p>The tools and systems I learnt changed everything for me, making me feel free to dump hoards of random information that I have been carrying around in my brain, as well as giving some much needed organisation to the jumble of world documents, phone notes, notebooks, and other scribbles I have had all over the place to keep track of things I was learning, all of which now live as digitized markdown files in my obsidian vault. now when I start a new project, be that something creative, or just simply doing some research on finding a nice pair of shoes, I start an obsidian note (or sometimes a folder) under the appropriate category in my vault to help me keep track of my thoughts and progress.</p>
<p>Today I have a decently sized (and growing) collection of notes on all sorts of topics that I have developed interests in over time, and on occasion I find myself with some notes I would like to put out into the world, either because I have been specifically asked to like in the case of some recipes, or because I have spent some time creating some resources and documenting some workflows for hobbies that I know will likely benefit someone looking for them, such as my post on <a href="https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/making-paper-minis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">creating cheap miniatures for D&amp;D</a>. and that is why I decided that in the year of 2025, I would create my own website.</p>
