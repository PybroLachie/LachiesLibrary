<h1 id="welcome-to-lachies-library">Welcome to Lachie&rsquo;s Library!</h1>
<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>My name is Lachie, I am a professional 3D artist and game developer, with a bunch of other hobbies, including gaming, playing and running D&amp;D, world building, building computers, camping, cooking, and more. I created this website as a place to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects- The silly ones and the cool ones alike! along with some custom resources for various hobbies I have created and would like to share.</p>
<h3 id="why-make-a-website">Why make a website?</h3>
<p>I have always had a habit of developing random interests and hobbies that I tend to get very deep into rather quickly, some of these last for a few weeks, others a few months, and some I have been interested in and working on for over a decade now. throughout all these hobbies and interests I would often attempt to take notes and document my workflows, however for a long time I got stuck on trying to organise my thoughts, and the organisation and documentation became it&rsquo;s own fixation, one I found overwhelming, and often ended up doing poorly or not at all due to a lack of a proper system.</p>
<p>This all changed for me when I discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Obsidian</a>, A free markdown based note taking program that allowed me to shape my note taking system to be whatever I needed it to be, as well as learning about some popular &ldquo;<a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">second brain</a>&rdquo; methods including <a href="https://workflowy.com/systems/para-method/#:~:text=The%20system%20was%20developed%20by,work%20at%20his%20consulting%20job." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PARA</a> by Tiago Forte, and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=The%20Zettelkasten%20method%20was%20invented,system%2C%20dubbed%20the%20Zettelkasten%20method." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">zettelkasten</a> by Niklas Luhmann, both of which I use elements of in my own hybrid note taking system today.</p>
<p>The tools and systems I learnt changed everything for me, making me feel free to dump hoards of random information that I have been carrying around in my brain, as well as giving some much needed organisation to the jumble of world documents, phone notes, notebooks, and other scribbles I have had all over the place to keep track of things I was learning, all of which now live as digitized markdown files in my obsidian vault. now when I start a new project, be that something creative, or just simply doing some research on finding a nice pair of shoes, I start an obsidian note (or sometimes a folder) under the appropriate category in my vault to help me keep track of my thoughts and progress.</p>
<p>Today I have a decently sized (and growing) collection of notes on all sorts of topics that I have developed interests in over time, and on occasion I find myself with some notes I would like to put out into the world, either because I have been specifically asked to like in the case of some recipes, or because I have spent some time creating some resources and documenting some workflows for hobbies that I know will likely benefit someone looking for them, such as my post on <a href="https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/making-paper-minis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">creating cheap miniatures for D&amp;D</a>. and that is why in the year 2025, I created my own website.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is my personal setup for game development and 3D art, I obtained parts of it over a long period of time including before attending college, during my studies, and after I started working professionally. I point this out as it is important to me that anyone reading this who is interested in getting into game dev understands that they <strong>Do not</strong> need to obtain this kind of equipment to get started, I started 3D modelling on an <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/179172?baseline=179172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">old Toshiba laptop</a> with no graphics card and 4gb of DDR3 RAM, and later built a simple PC with an <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QbGj4D/intel-core-i5-7500-34ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i57500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">i5-7500</a> processor and a <a href="https://www.mwave.com.au/archive/asus-geforce-gtx-1050-phoenix-2gb-video-card-ac08304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">GTX 1050</a> graphics card which actually did quite well for a long time, so please do not let a lack of equipment prevent you from getting started.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="equipment-required">Equipment Required:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mixer with dough hooks</li>
<li>3 stainless steel or ceramic bowls</li>
<li>plastic wrap</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of warm water (about 40 degrees Celsius)</li>
<li>8 grams of dry yeast</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>3 1/2 cups of plain flour</li>
<li>5 tablespoons of olive oil for cooking</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method---creating-the-dough">Method - creating the dough</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour in mixing bowl, mix on lowest setting until just combined.</li>
<li>add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 30 seconds</li>
<li>add 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 8 minutes (giving your mixer breaks based on your instruction manual).</li>
<li>During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything).</li>
<li>take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine).
<ol>
<li>the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife.</li>
<li>it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours.
<ol>
<li>if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="method---working-with-the-dough">Method - working with the dough</h3>
<ol>
<li>preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>line a pizza tray with baking paper.</li>
<li>take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour.</li>
<li>take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour.
<ol>
<li>if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed.</li>
<li>transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this).</li>
<li>add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese.</li>
<li>repeat for remaining dough balls.</li>
<li>cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>for an extra crunchy crust, you can add a light brushing of olive oil to the outer rim of your pizza</li>
<li></li>
