I created this website as a place to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects- The silly ones and the cool ones alike! along with some custom resources for various hobbies I have created and would like to share.</p><h3 id=why-make-a-website>Why make a website?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-make-a-website>#</a></h3><p>I have always had a habit of developing random interests and hobbies that I tend to get very deep into rather quickly, some of these last for a few weeks, others a few months, and some I have been interested in and working on for over a decade now. throughout all these hobbies and interests I would often attempt to take notes and document my workflows, however for a long time I got stuck on trying to organise my thoughts, and the organisation and documentation became it&rsquo;s own fixation, one I found overwhelming, and often ended up doing poorly or not at all due to a lack of a proper system.</p><p>This all changed for me when I discovered <a href=https://obsidian.md/>Obsidian</a>, A free markdown based note taking program that allowed me to shape my note taking system to be whatever I needed it to be, as well as learning about some popular &ldquo;<a href=https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/>second brain</a>&rdquo; methods including <a href="https://workflowy.com/systems/para-method/#:~:text=The%20system%20was%20developed%20by,work%20at%20his%20consulting%20job.">PARA</a> by Tiago Forte, and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=The%20Zettelkasten%20method%20was%20invented,system%2C%20dubbed%20the%20Zettelkasten%20method.">zettelkasten</a> by Niklas Luhmann, both of which I use elements of in my own hybrid note taking system today.</p><p>The tools and systems I learnt changed everything for me, making me feel free to dump hoards of random information that I have been carrying around in my brain, as well as giving some much needed organisation to the jumble of world documents, phone notes, notebooks, and other scribbles I have had all over the place to keep track of things I was learning, all of which now live as digitized markdown files in my obsidian vault. now when I start a new project, be that something creative, or just simply doing some research on finding a nice pair of shoes, I start an obsidian note (or sometimes a folder) under the appropriate category in my vault to help me keep track of my thoughts and progress.</p><p>Today I have a decently sized (and growing) collection of notes on all sorts of topics that I have developed interests in over time, and on occasion I find myself with some notes I would like to put out into the world, either because I have been specifically asked to like in the case of some recipes, or because I have spent some time creating some resources and documenting some workflows for hobbies that I know will likely benefit someone looking for them, such as my post on <a href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/making-paper-minis/>creating cheap miniatures for D&amp;D</a>. and that is why in the year 2025, I created my own website.</p><p>You can see a list of my current blog posts <a href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/>Here</a></p></div><article class="first-entry home-info"><header class=entry-header><h1>Welcome to Lachie&rsquo;s Library 📚</h1></header><div class=entry-content>Welcome to my blog</div><footer class=entry-footer><div class=social-icons><a href=https://x.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=X><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M18.244 2.25h3.308l-7.227 8.26 8.502 11.24H16.17l-5.214-6.817L4.99 21.75H1.68l7.73-8.835L1.254 2.25H8.08l4.713 6.231zm-1.161 17.52h1.833L7.084 4.126H5.117z"/></svg>

I point this out as it is important to me that anyone reading this who is interested in getting into game dev understands that they Do not need to obtain this kind of equipment to get started, I started 3D modelling on an old Toshiba laptop with no graphics card and 4gb of DDR3 RAM, and later built a simple PC with an i5-7500 processor and a GTX 1050 graphics card which actually did quite well for a long time, so please do not let a lack of equipment prevent you from getting started.

During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything). take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine). the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife. it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises. place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap. leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours. if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount. Method - working with the dough preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius. line a pizza tray with baking paper. take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour. take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour. if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle. press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed. transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this). add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese. repeat for remaining dough balls. cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base. Notes: for an extra crunchy crust, you can add a light brushing of olive oil to the outer rim of your pizza</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-03-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 12, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;528 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lachie</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Pizza Dough Recipie" href=http://localhost:1313/LachiesLibrary/posts/pizza-dough-recipie/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Formatting test</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>This is just regular test

What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.
