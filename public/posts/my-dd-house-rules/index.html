Critical hit and failure
In Combat
Rolling a natural 20 will automatically hit whatever you were attacking, you double the amount of dice you would normally roll for damage (for example, if attacking with a dagger which does 1d4+2 damage normally, a natural 20 will do 2d4 + 2 damage).
Rolling a natural 1 in combat will prevent the attack from hitting it&rsquo;s target, depending on the circumstances the attack may simply miss, or it may backfire in a more spectacular way."><meta name=author content="Lachie"><link rel=canonical href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-dd-house-rules/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/LachiesLibrary/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-dd-house-rules/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-dd-house-rules/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Lachies Library"><meta property="og:title" content="My D&D House Rules"><meta property="og:description" content="These are the house rules I use when I run D&amp;D, intended for use with D&amp;D 5e (2014)

Resource tracking Ammo non magical or otherwise non-modified ammo is not tracked, if you have a bow and quiver with 20 arrows, it is assumed that you manage to retrieve them from the battlefield during / after combat. If combat reaches a point where you may have actually used all 20 arrows (rare) then I may tell you that your quiver has run dry - however you do not need to track this, I will. the same goes for crossbow bolts, slingshot ammo, etc.\nmagical or otherwise modified ammo is tracked, and is often consumed on use, for example a magical arrow that does an additional 1d6 frost damage, would either be destroyed, or converted back into a regular arrow after firing it. modified items such as poisoned darts can be collected but in their regular state, for example if you fired a poisoned dart at a creature, you could reclaim it after combat, but it would now be a regular dart.\nMisc Drinking a potion is a bonus action You may use your bonus action to consume a potion. You are still allowed to spend your main action on consuming a potion, however you may not consume more than 1 potion in 1 turn (no using your bonus action AND action to consume multiple potions).\n","wordCount":"629","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lachie"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-dd-house-rules/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lachies
