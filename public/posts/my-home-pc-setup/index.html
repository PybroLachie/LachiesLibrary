I do however find it very helpful for controlling my virtual webcam during meetings and while running online classes, and as this list is for my entire setup, it is included. Wacom intous pro medium: this is the tablet to get! that said many alternatives from huion or others can also work great and be at least 80% as good. what is more important on a tablet hunt is to get one without a screen, I used to use a very large screen tablet, it was a good tablet and for someone doing a lot more 2D art it may be the better device, however for 3D art where tasks are often changing as you work through the pipeline, I found that the larger device took too long to get setup (even when being used as a monitor in it’s down time) and also provided worse ergonomics due to the neck needing to be craned down even a little bit when using it.

Google home: This lives on the desk so it is included on the list, it is good for some music and hands free controlling some home systems, it was also a birthday gift, I love it but would not recommend buying it for the purposes of making art. Network switch: good if you have a single cord running to your office / room and want a wired connection to few devices (in my case my main PC, my media PC, and a WIFI booster ) Placement fixings: I use these to secure items like the wireless charger and speaker stands to my desk, this comes in handy if you are a bit particular like me and want to make sure things will stay the safe after giving your setup a good clean. Knick-knack box: it’s a silly thing to recommend, but having a small box handy for USBs, trinkets, adapters, etc. can really help keep your space clear, for the couple dollars they go for its a huge recommend!
