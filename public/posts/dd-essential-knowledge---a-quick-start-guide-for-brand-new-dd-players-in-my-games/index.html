What is to follow is my attempt to condense down all essential first time D\u0026D knowledge into a simple and easy to follow guide. Just remember, the best way to learn D\u0026D is by playing it! So make a character, learn what you can about gameplay, and any gaps in your knowledge will be filled as you play!\nIf you wish to gain a high level overview of the game before any further reading, I recommend you watch this video by Ginny Di on YouTube, it is intended for people using the 2024 rules so a few words are slightly different however pretty much all of the explanation of how the game is played is the same.\nTechnical Info My D\u0026D games use the D\u0026D 5e (2014) ruleset, This is not to be confused with the D\u0026D 5.5e (2024) ruleset, It is easy to set D\u0026D beyond to use the 2014 rules only so that you do not need to worry about it, I will go over this when I talk about D\u0026D beyond later. What is D\u0026D / How do I play? High level D\u0026D Description D\u0026D Is a TTRPG (Table top roleplaying game), Which is to say that you play the game by sitting around a table narrating your actions. In the case of D\u0026D there are 2 types of players;\nPlayer characters Dungeon master A dungeon master is responsible for narrating the overall story, controlling NPCs (non-player characters), and overall running the game. A Player character (That’s you!) is responsible for controlling and narrating the actions of their individual character. Actions as a player character As a player you can essentially break down everything you do into 2 categories:\nOut of combat When out of combat, players are free to perform various actions at will, these actions include but are not limited to:\ntraveling from location to location (often within a town or settlement) speaking with NPCs (the player speaks as themselves and the DM speaks as the NPC the player is talking to) Bartering (functions the same as speaking with NPCs) exploring locations (either publicly or by sneaking around, this often includes skill checks which we will talk about later) Performing other miscellaneous actions. Some of these actions will require skill checks to perform, while others are just assumed possible, we will talk about skill checks later. In combat During combat the game becomes turn based, The order of turns is determined by an initiative roll, which is a roll of a D20 + plus your initiative modifier (we will speak about modifiers later when we speak about skill checks). I will explain combat further in one of the next sections.\nThe Dice! If you know nothing else about D\u0026D you will likely at least know 1 thing - there are lots of dice! these dice like in any game are used for generating random numbers, these numbers include the damage of weapons, the amount of heath regained by drinking a potion, etc. every item, spell, and weapon that involves a dice roll specifies which one it needs by identifying the die as a “D” followed by the number of sides, for example a 6 sided die is referred to as a “D6”, a 12 sided die is referred to as a “D12” etc. Notes:\n0 = maximum value: You will notice that the D10 has a 0 on it, it is important to note that this 0 actually represents 10. The D100: there will be times where you DM, or a class feature ask you to roll a “D100” you will notice that there is no 100 sided die in a standard set of dice. this roll is actually done by rolling the D10 along with the percentile die, adding the resulting numbers together. It is important to note that when rolling a D100 the 0 actually represents 0 instead of maximum value, unless you roll entirely 0s, in which case you have rolled a perfect 100 Multiple Dice: sometimes a weapon, spell, etc. Will call for rolling multiple dice, they will list this by writing the Number followed by the type, for example: 3D6 means roll 3 six sided dice. You do not need to buy any! if you have your own that you want to bring then that is totally encouraged! however I have plenty of spare dice for you to borrow if you like :)\nSkill checks / Saving throws At this stage I have mentioned skill checks a couple times, these are sometimes also referred to as saving throws. D\u0026D contains a series of skills used to attempt various tasks (Acrobatics, Deception, Stealth, etc.) every character has a modifier (sometimes positive, sometimes neutral, sometimes negative) for each of these skills listed on their character sheet, these are determined during the character creation process (more on that later).\nTo perform a skill check / saving throw, roll a D20, and add your modifier for the relevant skill, for example if your DM asks you to make a stealth saving throw, then you roll a D20, and apply your stealth modifier to it; After you roll your saving throw and add the modifier you tell your DM the final number, they will then tell you if you failed or succeeded in what you were trying to do. It is important to note that in order to make a saving throw to attempt something you must first need to be asked / approved to do so. for example you may say that you want to try and break down a door, your DM will ask you to make a strength check, then you will do it and say the result. You can not however simply roll a strength check without asking and then say “hey I wanna knock down the door also I rolled a 16”, the reasoning for this will become clear as you play the game, but it’s mostly about keeping discussions / options clear as well as giving your DM the opportunity to tell you that you can not do something / give your fellow players the chance you talk you out of it.\nIf you wish to accomplish a task in a certain way then you can request the specific skill check, for example if you want to get through a door by picking the lock, you can specifically ask your DM “can I make a slight of hand check to try picking the lock on the door”. Requests like this feel more natural as you keep playing the game, but at the start it is totally fine to just say “hey I want to try and get through this door” and let your DM tell you what check to make.\nYou should also note that not every action in the game requires a skill check, for example if you want to just pick up a simple object or walk across a room for example, you just say that you do it, no check required. If you feel unsure as to if you can perform an action, just say that you try to do it and the DM will tell you if a check is required, you will get a feel for it as you play.\nCombat!
