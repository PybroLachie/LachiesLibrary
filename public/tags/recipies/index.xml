<h3 id="equipment-required">Equipment Required:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mixer with dough hooks</li>
<li>3 stainless steel or ceramic bowls</li>
<li>plastic wrap</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of warm water (about 40 degrees Celsius)</li>
<li>8 grams of dry yeast</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>3 1/2 cups of plain flour</li>
<li>5 tablespoons of olive oil for cooking</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method---creating-the-dough">Method - creating the dough</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour in mixing bowl, mix on lowest setting until just combined.</li>
<li>add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 30 seconds</li>
<li>add 1 cup of flour, mix on medium/high for 8 minutes (giving your mixer breaks based on your instruction manual).</li>
<li>During or after kneading your dough in the mixer, line up 3 bowls and use the remaining olive oil to oil up the inside of the bowls (the measurement does not need to be exact! just get a light coating on everything).</li>
<li>take your finished large ball of dough and weight on digital scale, divide into 3 roughly even portions (a few grams of is fine).
<ol>
<li>the easiest way to separate the dough is to grab 2 sections with your hands and twist, you can also cut it with a knife.</li>
<li>it is okay if you end up needing to tear some more dough of a ball to get it to get all your portions to the right weight, you can lightly knead this back together before the dough rises.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>place the 3 divided dough balls into the 3 oiled bowls, use the ball to rub the outside of the bowl, try to get the entire ball covered in oil, cover the bowls snugly with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>leave to rest for ATLEAST 1 hours.
<ol>
<li>if you like, you can put it in the fridge for 24 hours for a slow rise, the resulting dough is a bit nicer- but not by a huge amount.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="method---working-with-the-dough">Method - working with the dough</h3>
<ol>
<li>preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>line a pizza tray with baking paper.</li>
<li>take large cutting board and lightly coat with some of the remaining flour.</li>
<li>take a single ball of dough out of a bowl and place on the cutting board, sprinkle with some flour.
<ol>
<li>if you find the dough hard to work with, you can dust your hands with flour as well to make the slippery dough easier to handle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>press the dough down into a disc shape, adding more flour if needed.</li>
<li>transfer the dough disc from the cutting board to the lined pizza tray, continue to press down until reaching desired size (I like a thin crust and often push mine right to the edges of a large tray to achieve this).</li>
<li>add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese.</li>
<li>repeat for remaining dough balls.</li>
<li>cook time varies based on pizza toppings, but typically a cook time of 12-20 minutes results in a beautiful crust and a light fluffy base.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>for an extra crunchy crust, you can add a light brushing of olive oil to the outer rim of your pizza</li>
