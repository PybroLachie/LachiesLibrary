<h2 id="back-story">Back Story</h2>
<p>I’ve been playing TTRPGs (specifically D&amp;D 5e) for quite a while now, both as a player and as a DM, and combat naturally is a large part of those games, up until recently all combat I have ever played has been “theatre of the mind” and while there is nothing wrong with that (in fact in certain cases it is likely superior) I had always wanted to do tactical combat on a battle map, however as I spent many of my early D&amp;D playing years as a teenager with no disposable income – the cost for minis and maps was just too much to justify when I would often only play a few sessions a year. What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.</p>]]></description>
