      <title>My D&amp;D House Rules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the house rules I use when I run D&amp;amp;D, intended for use with D&amp;amp;D 5e (2014)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-hit-and-failure&#34;&gt;Critical hit and failure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In Combat:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Rolling a natural 20 will automatically hit whatever you were attacking, you double the amount of dice you would normally roll for damage (for example, if attacking with a dagger which does 1d4+2 damage normally, a natural 20 will do 2d4 + 2 damage)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-story&#34;&gt;Back Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing TTRPGs (specifically D&amp;amp;D 5e) for quite a while now, both as a player and as a DM, and combat naturally is a large part of those games, up until recently all combat I have ever played has been “theatre of the mind” and while there is nothing wrong with that (in fact in certain cases it is likely superior) I had always wanted to do tactical combat on a battle map, however as I spent many of my early D&amp;amp;D playing years as a teenager with no disposable income – the cost for minis and maps was just too much to justify when I would often only play a few sessions a year. What is to follow is the journey of learning to make cheap paper minis (about $0.12 AUD per mini), some workflows and materials I have tried and would recommend, and some places to find resources, all things I wish I had known about back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
