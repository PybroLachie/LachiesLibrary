      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a silly thing to blog, but that has never stopped me before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My early days of playing minecraft were spent playing a free light weight creative only version of the game through a web browser, a version that is today known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Classic&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;minecraft classic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, some time later (bare in mind I was around the age of 8 or 9 years old at this time and my memory of the passing of time from then is not fantastic) a newer version of minecraft of the game was announced, one that would require a paid account (This version of the game is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Indev&#34;&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;). Some classic childhood parental begging occurred - a joint effort between me and my older brother, and some time later they agreed to buy an account for the 2 of us to share (best day ever, thanks mum and dad).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tales from Alumantia Pt.1 - A fresh start</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;World seed for those interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Seed: -1412583731547517931
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world-begins&#34;&gt;The world begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spawning in and taking a look around, I am immediately greeted by some absolutely stunning visuals, giving me an even deeper appreciation for the work that has been done by Mojang on the world generation system, I may be very nostalgic for the old beta style terrain, but this new system is beautiful.

Admittedly the high performance I experience with these shaders is partially accredited to the specs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pybrolachie.github.io/LachiesLibrary/posts/my-home-pc-setup/&#34;&gt;my PC&lt;/a&gt;, but I have found that these shaders set to lower settings can still produce very playable framerates on my laptop, which is of lower specs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
